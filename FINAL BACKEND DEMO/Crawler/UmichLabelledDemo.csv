@attribute DESCRIPTION {N/A,'About the Course This course will focus on Western classical music of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; it is designed for people who are passionate about classical music but who have not necessarily had any advanced training or taken any college-level music courses.','CHEM 216 builds on the experimental approach started in CHEM 211. Students participate in planning exactly what they are going to do in the laboratory by being given general goals and directions that have to be adapted to fit the specific project they will be working on.','This course covers the basic principles of elastic behavior for different materials such as wood; steel; concrete; and composite materials and compares the properties and applications of materials generally.','This course is primarily devoted to the fundamental principles of valuation. We will learn and apply the concepts of time value of money and risk to understand the major determinants of value creation. We will use both theory and real world examples to demonstrate how to value any asset.','This course explores techniques for assessment of reading and writing skills and for development of individualized instruction in classroom settings; develops strategies for meeting the needs of individual students through the evaluation; utilization; and adaptation of commercial reading materials and through the formation of principles and techniq','This seminar series is designed to expose students to entrepreneurship through interaction with experienced entrepreneurs; business leaders; and venture capitalists as well as individuals involved in emerging business models; new venture creation; and technology commercialization.','The impact of technology and networks on our lives; culture; and society continues to increase. The very fact that you can take this course from anywhere in the world requires a technological infrastructure that was designed; engineered; and built over the past sixty years.','Everything is connected: people; information; events and places; all the more so with the advent of online social media. A practical way of making sense of the tangle of connections is to analyze them as networks.','This course introduces the student to global health concepts and the network of organizations working to advance health care internationally.  Emphasis for this course is on the global burden of disease and determinates of health. It will provide the student with a broad introduction to programs; systems and policies affecting global health.','This is an introductory course in research methods and proposal writing. The course is designed to give students experience in hypothesis and specific aims development and an overview of the use of the scientific study design for solving health-related problems.','Each semester; ten Master of Public Health students from the University of Michigan participate in a course on Communicating Science through Social Media.','This course seeks to make students sensitive to and articulate about the ways in which moral and political values come into play in the American policy process; particularly as they affect non-elected public officials who work in a world shaped by politics.','The main objective of this course is to explore and critique the role of an open pedagogy in education. Participants will develop an understanding of the concept of open and explore its application in; primarily; the context of educational environments as well as use and assess emerging learning technologies and social media.','This lecture course aims to introduce students to how science and technology issues both shape and are shaped by public policy. Issues such as global climate change; energy sustainability; human genomics; and exponentially evolving technologies (e.g; info-; bio-; and nano-) are among the most challenging and complex facing contemporary society.','Measuring Health Disparities is designed to be accessible to a broad audience of practitioners across all sectors of the public health workforce. In contains audio and interactive elements and focuses on some basic issues for public health practice - how to understand; define; and measure health disparity. The material is divided into four parts.','This course will provide you with an introduction to the most powerful engineering principles you will ever learn: thermodynamics! Or the science of transferring energy from one place or form to another place or form.  We will introduce the tools you need to analyze energy systems from solar panels; to engines; to insulated coffee mugs.','Fast Start is a two-week intensive program for high school students in Liberia designed to spark interest in careers in engineering in agriculture. The course; which includes five regional camps of 80 students each; is modeled after the M-STEM program at University of Michigan.','Computer technology has transformed how we participate in democracy. The way we cast our votes; the way our votes are counted; and the way we choose who will lead are increasingly controlled by invisible computer software. Most U.S.','() This course uses an open textbook University of Michigan Chemical Engineering Process Dynamics and Controls. The articles in the open textbook (wikibook) are all written by teams of 3-4 senior chemical engineering students; and are peer-reviewed by other members of the class.','SPANISH 103 is an introductory course to the Spanish language and culture. This course uses a task and content-based approach to learning which integrates grammar in a functional use through listening; speaking; reading; and writing. Language use is encouraged through communicative activities rather than a sequence of linguistic units.','This seminar provides students an opportunity to do in-depth research into an information policy topic of their interest. Students will gain an understanding of current United States Government Policy in areas involved with information and information technology. Policies are forming and changing daily.','This course introduces students to the conceptual; institutional; and practical foundations of information policy analysis and design. The course explores the regulatory histories; paradigms; processes; and actors shaping the ongoing development of the information field.','In 2009; the University of Michigan Department of Emergency Medicine working with global health partners at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH); Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST); Ghana College of Physicians and Surgeons; and the Ghana Ministry of Health established the Ghana Emergency Medicine Collaborative.','The nonprofit sector has emerged as one of the cornerstones of American society; and yet remains very much a work in progress. The “third sector” faces unique and evolving pressures in areas such as social enterprise; philanthropy; mission focus; performance measurement; sector blur; and more.'}
