The course will use examples from real vaccine trials to demonstrate the application of the FDA Code of Federal Regulations and ICH GCP Guidelines to explore methods and best practices involved in implementing phase I and II vaccine clinical trials.  This short course offering through Coursera is based on our work at the Center for Immunization Research and an in-depth graduate course taught at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.   We hope it inspires you to work in this exciting field.,Appropriate for all,?

Duration: 1.5 hours.  Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Sound Amazing Singing From The Diaphragm; Udemy; online Music courses,N/A,Online Course - Sound Amazing Singing From The Diaphragm,Udemy,$49,1.5 hours,Yes,Eric Arceneaux,About This Singing Course: Master your diaphragm and its surrounding muscles; and you will certainly unearth your true vocal potential.  Developing a great singing voice is about more than just your vocal cords; your whole body can be a source of power.  In particular; the muscles of your torso (back; abdomen; ribs; chest; pelvis) are of great value.  These muscles surround the diaphragm and aid it in functioning efficiently. This is the knowledge that singers like Carrie Underwood; Pavorotti; Renee Fleming; Celine Dione; David Phelps; and Christina Aguilera have taken full advantage of.   The Process Is Threefold: 1) We must awaken the muscles and reflexes that are your birthright to command; but have - unfortunately - become weak due to lack of use. 2) We must then strengthen these muscles and teach them to aid the diaphragm in fueling your voice. 3) Lastly; we must isolate and strengthen the diaphragm itself.  This is a very simple process; but one that has remained a  secret  amongst powerhouse vocalists for far too long. The Result: ENHANCED RANGE: The upper range becomes much easier to access! The larynx stabilizes; and register blend results more naturally. VOCAL PROTECTION: Learning to sing with a connection to the body provides a healthier means of sound production.  Incidence of hoarseness and vocal damage can be eliminated completely. IMPROVED CONTROL: With the torso muscles controlling the air; instead of the neck; the vocal folds are free to be more responsive to your mental commands.  Singing feels easier; more natural; and becomes more enjoyable. BEAUTIFUL TONE: An  ugly  or harsh tone is most often the result of excessive neck tension.  The true beauty and uniqueness of your voice is choked away; because of strain. When the tension is redirected to the proper torso muscles; the full overtones and true ring of the voice are restored. VIBRATO: It s a byproduct of healthy tension/breath pressure.  Vibrato frequently spontaneously results; as singers improve their breath control/body connection.   POWER/ BELTING: There is a very big difference between strong; powerful; beautiful singing and; well… yelling.  Singers who lack connection to the support base of their bodies will invariably sound like they re screeching; instead of singing powerfully.  The body connection makes all the difference in maintaining fullness and richness in belted tones. How Long Will It Take To See Results? Honestly; results are usually heard after the very first lesson. However; keep in mind that this is a process. We are building a support structure - a fuel base for your voice. With each lesson we will add another piece to the puzzle; until the picture is complete. The process WORKS; but you have to be diligent. Skipping lessons or failing to do the daily practice sessions is a surefire way to sabotage yourself. Some of the exercises seem so simple; maybe even too good to be true; other exercises are kind of silly. But they work! Suspend your disbelief. Give yourself a chance to realize your full vocal potential. After 5 weeks; you ll be singing better than you ever have before; and the lessons will continue to grow your voice for many weeks beyond that.,Appropriate for all,?

Make sure to check for reruns of this course. How do we understand architecture? One way of answering this question is by looking through the lens of history. This course will examine architecture through time; beginning with First Societies and extending to the 15th century. Though the course is chronological; it is not intended as a linear narrative; but rather aims to provide a more global view; by focusing on different architectural  moments.  The lectures will give students the appropriate grounding for understanding a range of buildings and contexts. The material in the lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook A Global History of Architecture. Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations; such as Buddhism and Hinduism; produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico? These are typical questions that the lectures will address. All required readings are available within the courseware; courtesy of Wiley. Print or electronic versions of the A Global History of Architecture; Second Edition and Architecture of First Societies are also available for purchase. The course is aimed for a general audience at the undergraduate level with an interest in history. All lectures will be in English.

GGP is an interesting application in its own right.  It is intellectually engaging and more than a little fun.  But it is much more than that.  It provides a theoretical framework for modeling discrete dynamic systems and for defining rationality in a way that takes into account problem representation and complexities like incompleteness of information and resource bounds.  It has practical applications in areas where these features are important; e.g. in business and law.  More fundamentally; it raises questions about the nature of intelligence and serves as a laboratory in which to evaluate competing approaches to artificial intelligence. This course is an introduction to General Game Playing (GGP).  Students will get an introduction to the theory of General Game Playing and will learn how to create GGP programs capable of competing against other programs and humans.,Appropriate for all,?

In this course you will study the second 20 Kanji and learn 148 of 530 compounds. A compound is when you take a Kanji character and combine it with another Kanji character. This is the way to really build your vocabulary. For example; we ll take the single Kanji for 9 ? and combine it with the single Kanji for month ? to form September which is ??. The video format of this course provides a convenient way to review the Kanji over and over again. However; there will also be a great deal of reviewing as we go along. The course format relies heavily on building and repetition. Each lesson except for lesson 1 includes a quiz and a review of the previous lessons. In the section called;  What have we learned so far?  The Kanji from the previous lessons will be presented in a slideshow in random order. This will allow you to review everything you ve studied before proceeding to the next lesson. In addition to this we will also revisit what you studied in course 1 in 4 flashback quizzes. Take pride in learning to read long and short sentences and Have fun becoming literate in Japanese. An Article by the creator of this course on how to start studying Japanese Kanji and a resource list are posted below. How to start Studying Japanese Kanji Studying Japanese Kanji can be a little bit scary; especially if your first language is English where you only have to learn 26 letters.Up until a few years ago; the standard for Japanese literacy was the Joyo Kanji; a list of 1945 essential use Kanji that had to be learned before graduating from a Japanese High School. Foreigners who could read those 1945 Kanji were considered literate in Japanese.Recently the number of Joyo Kanji has increased from 1945 to 2136.Foreigners who want to be as literate in Japanese as a High School graduate will need to master 2136 Kanji. At first glance; memorizing 2136 individual Kanji pictographs may seem a little daunting and because the number 2136 is a little scary; foreigners living and working in Japan or just interested in Japanese culture sometimes put off studying Kanji for years.Another obstacle is that if it’s not possible for you to travel to Japan to study Japanese at a Japanese language school; Japanese self-study can be a little bit intimidating.However; with the right tools it is possible to learn Japanese Kanji. These 5 Kanji study techniques will help you to begin reading Japanese today. Kanji study technique #1. The first step is to remove the fear of memorizing2136 separate Kanji characters.One of the best tools for eliminating this fear is a book called “Remembering the Kanji” by James Heisig.The first 125 pages of Remembering the Kanji are available online at the Remembering the Kanji website. In this book Mr. Heisig breaks Kanji down into separate parts called radicals.Several Kanji lists identify 214 radicals. So before you try to memorize 2136 characters; it’s a good idea to memorize those 214 radicals first.214 is a lot easier than 2136.Here is a quick demonstration of how Kanji radicals work.After you’ve memorized the radical which means woman?and the radical which means child ?; when you see ??? in a sentence; it will not be so scary and you’ll know that it means baby girl or female child (Onna no ko).This technique is also a good way to learn a lot of compounds. Compounds are Kanji combinations that form words.For example; after you’ve learned that the Kanji for mountain?is yama and the Kanji for mouth of opening is kuchi ? or ~guchi; it will be very easy to read the Japanese last name Yamaguchi??. Kanji study technique #2. The next step when memorizing Kanji is to have a goal or a list of Kanji that you’d like to learn.An easy goal that you can start right now is to learn the Kanji characters for the Kanji numbers from 1 to 10. It’s extremely easy; especially considering that 1 is ?; 2 is? and three is?. So you really only have to learn the characters from 4 to 10. Kanji study technique #3 Some Kanji students like to study Kanji in the same order that Japanese students learn them.Each year more kanji are added until all 2136 have been covered.In a Japanese Elementary school; in Grade 1; you would learn 80 Kanji; Grade 2:160 Kanji; Grade 3:200 Kanji; Grade 4:200; Grade 5:185 and Grade 6:181.Over the course of High School; you would learn the additional 1; 130 Kanji. If you live in Japan; have a child going through school in Japan; or have access to the graded texts used in Japanese schools; this is a good structured way to work towards fluency. Kanji study technique #4 Another Goal; a lot of Kanji students have is the JLPT (Japanese Language proficiency test). The JLPT is a standardized test that can be taken each year which covers reading Kanji; grammar; vocabulary and listening. There are 5 Levels; JLPT N5; JLPT N4; JLPT N3; JLPT N2 and JLPT N1. In the past; there were only four levels but a new level JLPT N5 has recently been created. Level N4 has been split into N5 and N4 and the N5 Kanji list includes the 80 Kanji that Grade 1 Japanese students learn which are called the????ichinensei Kanji. JLPT exams are held every year in cities across the world. In the past; the JLPT association provided a Kanji list and students would be able to study from a list of Kanji that would be on the test. This made JLPT test preparation a little easier.The JLPT has since amended its policy in the interest of creating more well-rounded students; not simply students that have memorized a list.The JLPT association recommends several Kanji texts on their website. Kanji study technique #5 For beginners who are new to Kanji; textbooks that are filled entirely with Japanese only and have no Kanji to English or Kanji to Romaji translation can be a little discouraging. The online Japanese course “Learn 80 JLPT N5 Kanji and 530 Japanese compounds” takes away a little bit of the fear of reading a textbook that is entirely in Japanese.The course provides a video slideshow of the Kanji radicals you need to learn;short videos of the Kanji being drawn before the lesson; on yomi and Kun yomi Kanji readings; a list of the Kanji readings in English; hiragana and Romaji and example sentences for each Kanji. Since the way Japanese people learn Kanji themselves is by years and years of having to draw the Kanji over and over; the course mimics the repetition available in a Japanese elementary school or High School; by short videos that can be watched repeatedly instead of a bulky textbook.Constant quizzing and review after each lesson also mimics the repetitive environment of a Japanese school until all 530 Kanji have been mastered. The bottomline is this: Kanji is not impossible. All that is needed is a plan and the right resources.A list of resources is provided below and with determination and patience; everyone can learn how to read Japanese Kanji.

In this course you will study the first 20 Kanji and learn 121 of 530 compounds. A compound is when you take a Kanji character and combine it with another Kanji character. This is the way to really build your vocabulary. For example; we ll take the single Kanji for 9 ? and combine it with the single Kanji for month ? to form September which is ??. The video format of this course provides a convenient way to review the Kanji over and over again. However; there will also be a great deal of reviewing as we go along. The course format relies heavily on building and repetition. Each lesson except for lesson 1 includes a quiz and a review of the previous lessons. In the section called;  What have we learned so far?  The kanji from the previous lessons will be presented in a slideshow in random order. This will allow you to review everything you ve studied before proceeding to the next lesson. Take pride in learning to read long and short sentences and Have fun becoming literate in Japanese. 80 JLPT Kanji and 530 compounds Part 2 An Article by the creator of this course on how to start studying Japanese Kanji and a resource list are posted below. How to start Studying Japanese Kanji Studying Japanese Kanji can be a little bit scary; especially if your first language is English where you only have to learn 26 letters.Up until a few years ago; the standard for Japanese literacy was the Joyo Kanji; a list of 1945 essential use Kanji that had to be learned before graduating from a Japanese High School. Foreigners who could read those 1945 Kanji were considered literate in Japanese.Recently the number of Joyo Kanji has increased from 1945 to 2136.Foreigners who want to be as literate in Japanese as a High School graduate will need to master 2136 Kanji. At first glance; memorizing 2136 individual Kanji pictographs may seem a little daunting and because the number 2136 is a little scary; foreigners living and working in Japan or just interested in Japanese culture sometimes put off studying Kanji for years.Another obstacle is that if it’s not possible for you to travel to Japan to study Japanese at a Japanese language school; Japanese self-study can be a little bit intimidating.However; with the right tools it is possible to learn Japanese Kanji. These 5 Kanji study techniques will help you to begin reading Japanese today. Kanji study technique #1. The first step is to remove the fear of memorizing2136 separate Kanji characters.One of the best tools for eliminating this fear is a book called “Remembering the Kanji” by James Heisig.The first 125 pages of Remembering the Kanji are available online at the Remembering the Kanji website. In this book Mr. Heisig breaks Kanji down into separate parts called radicals.Several Kanji lists identify 214 radicals. So before you try to memorize 2136 characters; it’s a good idea to memorize those 214 radicals first.214 is a lot easier than 2136.Here is a quick demonstration of how Kanji radicals work.After you’ve memorized the radical which means woman?and the radical which means child ?; when you see ??? in a sentence; it will not be so scary and you’ll know that it means baby girl or female child (Onna no ko).This technique is also a good way to learn a lot of compounds. Compounds are Kanji combinations that form words.For example; after you’ve learned that the Kanji for mountain?is yama and the Kanji for mouth of opening is kuchi ? or ~guchi; it will be very easy to read the Japanese last name Yamaguchi??. Kanji study technique #2. The next step when memorizing Kanji is to have a goal or a list of Kanji that you’d like to learn.An easy goal that you can start right now is to learn the Kanji characters for the Kanji numbers from 1 to 10. It’s extremely easy; especially considering that 1 is ?; 2 is? and three is?. So you really only have to learn the characters from 4 to 10. Kanji study technique #3 Some Kanji students like to study Kanji in the same order that Japanese students learn them.Each year more kanji are added until all 2136 have been covered.In a Japanese Elementary school; in Grade 1; you would learn 80 Kanji; Grade 2:160 Kanji; Grade 3:200 Kanji; Grade 4:200; Grade 5:185 and Grade 6:181.Over the course of High School; you would learn the additional 1; 130 Kanji. If you live in Japan; have a child going through school in Japan; or have access to the graded texts used in Japanese schools; this is a good structured way to work towards fluency. Kanji study technique #4 Another Goal; a lot of Kanji students have is the JLPT (Japanese Language proficiency test). The JLPT is a standardized test that can be taken each year which covers reading Kanji; grammar; vocabulary and listening. There are 5 Levels; JLPT N5; JLPT N4; JLPT N3; JLPT N2 and JLPT N1. In the past; there were only four levels but a new level JLPT N5 has recently been created. Level N4 has been split into N5 and N4 and the N5 Kanji list includes the 80 Kanji that Grade 1 Japanese students learn which are called the????ichinensei Kanji. JLPT exams are held every year in cities across the world. In the past; the JLPT association provided a Kanji list and students would be able to study from a list of Kanji that would be on the test. This made JLPT test preparation a little easier.The JLPT has since amended its policy in the interest of creating more well-rounded students; not simply students that have memorized a list.The JLPT association recommends several Kanji texts on their website. Kanji study technique #5 For beginners who are new to Kanji; textbooks that are filled entirely with Japanese only and have no Kanji to English or Kanji to Romaji translation can be a little discouraging. The online Japanese course “Learn 80 JLPT N5 Kanji and 530 Japanese compounds” takes away a little bit of the fear of reading a textbook that is entirely in Japanese.The course provides a video slideshow of the Kanji radicals you need to learn;short videos of the Kanji being drawn before the lesson; on yomi and Kun yomi Kanji readings; a list of the Kanji readings in English; hiragana and Romaji and example sentences for each Kanji. Since the way Japanese people learn Kanji themselves is by years and years of having to draw the Kanji over and over; the course mimics the repetition available in a Japanese elementary school or High School; by short videos that can be watched repeatedly instead of a bulky textbook.Constant quizzing and review after each lesson also mimics the repetitive environment of a Japanese school until all 530 Kanji have been mastered. The bottomline is this: Kanji is not impossible. All that is needed is a plan and the right resources.A list of resources is provided below and with determination and patience; everyone can learn how to read Japanese Kanji.

The course offers presentations; demonstrations; and exercises for self- evaluation.  Assessment involves a variety of short compositions in common textures found during the 18th and 19th centuries. This course assumes that the student has had exposure to the basic principles of tonal harmony; musicianship; and/or some similar music theory introductory course.  Students should be fairly comfortable with roman numeral analysis or; at least; chord symbols and common harmonic progressions.  This course is not aimed exclusively at musicians with a classical music background.  Rock; pop; and jazz musicians might find this course interesting as a stylistic contrast to the genres they usually work in.,Appropriate for all,?

This means that being able to design programs - or at least be able to work with people who design programs - is becoming a more and more valuable skill. To build your own programs you need to know two things: how to use the specific programming language and libraries needed; and the more general skill of how to design a program. This course presents a design method that will enable you to approach the design of complex programs systematically. The method will work for programs in this course as well as hard to design programs you develop in the future. Using this method you will learn how to model the information in a problem domain; how to structure program data to mirror that information and how to further structure the data to lead to a well organized program. You will also learn to distinguish those parts of a program that are naturally data driven; from those that should use an alternative algorithmic approach. The method uses unit-tests to both produce a better developed design; and to test your program as you develop it. In the first course -- Part 1 -- we use a simple teaching language to cover the core of the design method. In Part 1 we cover various forms of data; simple interactive programs like games and animations; storing information in and rendering trees; and finally exploring search programs: programs that solve puzzles like Sudoku boards.  A second phase of the course; to be offered later;  will consist of parallel tracks; with each track using a different popular programming language and focusing on a different kind of problem. This will help you bring the design method to whatever language and problem domain interests you.,Appropriate for all,?

Functional programming has become more and more popular in recent years because it promotes code that’s safe; concise; and elegant. Furthermore; functional programming makes it easier to write parallel code for today’s and tomorrow’s multiprocessors by replacing mutable variables and loops with powerful ways to define and compose functions. Scala is a language that fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with Java and its tools. Scala is now used in a rapidly increasing number of open source projects and companies. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter; LinkedIn; Foursquare; Tumblr; and Klout. In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs; by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically. The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them; modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments; most of which are also programming projects.,Appropriate for all,?

The course not only explains how to write each business plan section; but each part of the course also deals with how your business should practically approach each of the business plan sections. The course is almost all video content. It should take between 1 to 2 hours to complete. You should take the course if you want to write a great business plan; or if you want to have a great plan for your business before you actually start it. The goal of the course is not just to teach you how to write a business plan. The true goal of the course is to also teach you to think intelligently about the different parts of your overall business. Let me explain a little bit about why I created this course. I originally created the Problemio.com business planning apps on Android and iPhone that now have 350;000+ downloads. And I saw thousands upon thousands of people making common business planning mistakes. Over time; I started a business coaching practice where one of the main services I offered was to help people write a business plan. But a business plan document by itself isn t going to make your business a success. You must execute on that business plan! And that is how I structured this course. As I go over each section of your business plan in the course; I also try to give actionable advice for how you can handle that part of your business once you get started. I wish you much luck; success; and enjoyment in your business. I sincerely hope that this course helps you; and look forward to hearing about your future success!,Appropriate for all,?

For 21 days; Harvard graduate; author and clinical psychologist Dr. Sean Sullivan walks with you step-by-step; applying the latest brain science to train your brain to master your strengths and obliterate your weaknesses. You ll create completely new brain patterns that enable you to healthily and sustainably lose the weight you choose to lose. Each day of your 21-Day Master Weight Loss Program begins with a very personal brain training video from Dr. Sullivan followed by your targeted Master Weight Loss Challenge. Progress at your own pace through 21 days of creating your personal NEW LIFE MAP leading to the body (and brain) you want. You ll be a Weight Loss Master losing the weight you want to lose.  Dr. Sullivan is a game-changing new voice in the psychology of peak performance.  - Mark Sanchez; NFL Quarterback ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Obliterate The Vicious Brain Cycle That Makes You Fat More than 90% of people who lose a lot of weight gain it back because of The Vicious Brain Cycle. Rather than changing your brain in a desired way; most diets end up tricking your brain into a short-term; unsustainable program of body manipulation. Over the long term you are actually training your brain to want to eat more; not less (New York Times). The Vicious Brain Cycle — 1. You feel overweight so you start a diet and lose some weight. 2. You hit a limit and begin to gain some weight back so you feel bad. 3. Within a year you are almost always coping by eating more and gaining all the weight back and often gaining even more weight. We have all heard of the thousands of diets—Atkins; South Beach; etc. It turns out; diets are almost always a formula for weight gain; not weight loss. They create “The Vicious Brain Cycle” because they fail at dealing with the heart of the weight loss problem. When you train your brain correctly; though; you actually want to eat and live differently. Your brain becomes extremely clear about how much you hate unhealthy food running your life. You come to see overeating; and foods that are bad for you; for what they really are—your massive enemies preventing you from feeling and looking good. Your brain ultimately controls what you want and what you do. So; the only way to lose weight and keep it off is to make intentional and sustained changes inside your brain. You need to train your brain to want to eat well by creating a Self-Promoting Brain Cycle so it becomes fait accompli that you drop weight and keep it off. I ll show you how to apply the discoveries of brain science to annihilate The Vicious Brain Cycle from your life. You will create new brain habits that ensure lasting changes in your brain and body. Your life will feel different; happier and healthier. You ll feel better because you’ll be rewiring your brain to lose the weight you want to lose. I’ll show you how do it. That’s what I do.

We now have new ways of working; new tools for working; new ways of living and even new ways of thinking as a result of the influence of technology on life; work and leisure. In the workplace; more workers are needed in multi-tasking; information and communications-based employment. Entrants to workplaces need skills to function effectively in this environment that have not traditionally been taught in our schools and universities. In this course; we identify some of these complex skills; and select one to examine in detail - collaborative problem solving - that combines both cognitive and social aspects and requires the ability to use and build knowledge. It is widely regarded by industry as one of the skills lacking in young people and graduates as they struggle to secure stable employment. In some countries the unemployment rates of graduates exceeds 50%. The new skills - often erroneously called soft skills - are not being developed in schools or universities and in many cases when they are; there is uncertainty regarding how to assess and teach them. In times of great change; when uncertainties dominate thinking about education and work; the result is often a paralysis in education and a reversion to rudimentary approaches to assessment that fail to inform directed learning and teaching. In this course we will focus on the nature of 21st century skills and their assessment; with a link to teaching styles and approaches suitable for a classroom in the 21st century.,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,On the Hunt for Feedback: Self-Directed Teacher Improvement; Coursera; online Education courses,N/A,Online Course - On the Hunt for Feedback: Self-Directed Teacher Improvement,Coursera,Free,12 weeks,Yes,N/A,On the Hunt for Feedback: Self-Directed Teacher Improvement Teaching is isolating.  Most of the work happens behind a closed door.  Teachers want feedback about their teaching; but encounter three problems: 1. They don t get much.  The principal or department head doesn t visit very often.  And there’s no built-in structure at their school for peer observation. 2. The feedback isn t helpful or actionable. Sometimes it s just happy talk -- 98% of American teachers are rated satisfactory -- and while everyone likes a pat on the back; evaluations that say  you were wonderful  don t make better teachers.  Or sometimes the feedback is critical in ways that don’t present clear next steps.  Sometimes it s vague or just plain wrong.   3. Some teachers can be defensive.   (Yes; we know – only SOME people are defensive; but not YOU.  You are different.  You handle feedback with grace; confidence; and a  let s fix this  orientation. {Except sometimes maybe not.}) *** This course is based on a simple idea: that teachers take control of their own improvement by aggressively seeking out and acting upon feedback about their teaching. The idea may be simple; but the work is not. So we should say straight up: this is NOT a typical MOOC. Participants in this MOOC won’t improve their teaching skills by just watching lectures. Participants also won’t really take anything away from this MOOC if they do it “a la carte:” we believe they need to do every part of every assignment in order to leverage the kinds of changes in practice that we think are possible in a course like this. We all wish that our public school system was such that every teacher would have easy access to great coaching – or even any coaching at all. But unfortunately that’s not the world we live in. Indeed; high school athletes can EXPECT to be coached; but schoolteachers somehow need to track it down themselves. Teachers deserve better. But they have a choice: bemoan the lack of legit coaching that they get and will likely continue to get; or become the rare teacher who builds her own improvement loop.   Class 1: The Big Picture on Teacher Feedback We will review the realities of teacher feedback in typical schools; looking at where that feedback usually comes to teachers and how it’s processed.  In most schools; the teacher plays a passive role in this—waiting until an evaluation comes to them.  We believe the best teachers create the opposite type of process: they HUNT down feedback; drag it back to their lairs; and use it.  They realize that if they wait for good feedback to come to them; they might wait a long; long time.   Class 2:  Case Study: Peer Feedback We profile teachers who ve asked their peers to give them critical feedback. How did they ask their colleagues for help? What rubric or observation protocol did they use? How did they choose what to focus on after they got the feedback? What kind of action/improvement plan did the teacher write? What happened when the teachers tried to implement their action steps? What did their peers say when they came back to their classroom a few weeks later? Participants in this course will do the exact same assignment: they will seek out feedback from a peer to generate their own action plan and a reflection on its implementation. Participants will also be assigned to give and receive feedback on these action plans from other students in our MOOC who are working on similar focus areas in similar contexts (e.g. other math teachers who are trying to improve the rigor of their questioning). Class 3: Case Study: Student Feedback   First we review the emerging new evidence; from the Gates Foundation MET Project; about student surveys and their power for accurately assessing teachers’ strengths and weaknesses.  Then; similar to the Peer Feedback class; we show a teacher going through all the steps; interspersed with commentary from the course instructor. Again; our MOOC participants will do the same assignment: create a student survey (we’ll show you examples); administer the survey; tabulate the data; write and implement a plan; and get and give feedback from/to a peer with a similar focus area. Class 4: Case Study: Assessment Data First we cover the evidence of how schools and teachers are using student assessment data to drive instructional improvements. Then we once again examine examples of teachers who go through all of the steps of administering a unit assessment; analyzing the data; and designing and implementing a targeted instructional intervention. MOOC participants will do the same assignment; and then get and give feedback from/to a peer who teaches a similar subject and/or grade level.   Course Learning Outcomes: To describe both structural and psychological impediments to teachers receiving effective feedback about their practice; as well as strategies to overcome those impediments.  To engage in self-directed improvement via three types of data collection—action plan—reflection assignments: peer observation; student surveys; and student assessment data analysis. To provide critical support and feedback to fellow MOOC participants who have similar teaching contexts and/or improvement focus areas. ,Appropriate for all,?

Alcock,In this class; we will ask and answer a series of questions about the role and practice of archaeology in the world today. If archaeologists are trained to investigate the past; what is left for us to study?  Who gets to be an archaeologist?  How and why do archaeologists hunt for “treasures”; and what do we do once we’ve discovered them?  What can we know; and not know; about people in the past?  What do archaeologists know about the past that most people would never guess – and why aren’t we telling you?  Why are people entirely willing to murder each other over the fate of archaeological sites?  Are Real Men alone capable of discovering the truth behind all this? Archaeology famously involves getting dirty in the line of duty.  Students will experience its hands-on nature; through the use of numerous exercises and archaeological case studies.  But there are other ‘dirty little secrets’ to learn about the field: not least how the stories archaeologists tell about the past have been used and abused; for purposes both good and bad.  Our goal by the end of the course is to have you ‘thinking like an archaeologist’ and fully aware of the often-fraught politics of doing archaeology around the globe.    ,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Sports and Building Aerodynamics; Coursera; online Math and Science courses,N/A,Online Course - Sports and Building Aerodynamics,Coursera,Free,6 weeks,Yes,N/A,Can the present outstanding records in cycling team time trials be further improved? Can the present world and Olympic records in athletics disciplines such as the 100 m sprint be advanced? This course provides the answer to these questions. It shows that aerodynamic processes in sports and around buildings are very complex and that many misconceptions exist. These misconceptions are caused by the often counter-intuitive flow physics. Interestingly; the same counter-intuitive flow physics govern the misconceptions in both sports and building aerodynamics. The insights from this course will help you to understand and improve the performance of top athletes and of modern building design. In 2013; team Orica-Green Edge set the fastest-ever average speed for a Tour de France team time trial; with 57.8 km/h over a distance of 25 km; beating team Omega-Pharma Quick-Step by a mere 0.75 s. At the subsequent 2013 UCI Road World Championships; the latter team beat the former by only 0.88 s. Clearly; even minor aerodynamic improvements can be decisive in these prestigious races. And; surprisingly; up to now; the optimum aerodynamic setting for a team time trial has not yet been explored. Records in athletics races such as the 100 m sprint; the 110 m hurdles and the long jump are only validated by the IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) when the tail wind does not exceed 2 m/s. Most world and Olympic records have been established at tail winds close to 2 m/s. Clearly; local aerodynamic effects can be decisive in establishing new records. Also here; the optimum aerodynamic setting has not yet been explored. New and prestigious building projects are realized in different parts of the world. Some of them feature the integration of wind energy systems in the building design. Also here; aerodynamic misconceptions can lead to suboptimal performance. The course starts with a brief recapitulation of the basic aspects of fluid flow: statics; kinematics; dynamics; flow regimes and boundary layers; including the atmospheric boundary layer in which sports and building aerodynamics take place. Next; the main aspects of the aerodynamic analysis techniques of wind tunnel testing and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are outlined. Tips and tricks for wind tunnel testing and CFD simulations are given. This knowledge provides the basis for the course parts on building aerodynamics; 100 m sprint aerodynamics and cycling aerodynamics; where some surprising and sometimes spectacular results will be shown.,Appropriate for all,?

There is no dearth of defined moral behavior created by religions and their leaders; business persons; politicians; philosophers; and in some cases “the everyday person on the street”. Example technologies at play today include nuclear energy; biological manipulations for warfare; robots for taking care of the elderly; and enhancing human capability; the use of technology for surveillance; the cultural changing power of the media which can create unlimited arrays of images real and virtual to support a point of view; and the internet with its world wide connectivity. We need to look into social/technology assessment; the transfer of the technology as it is placed into practice; and the techniques/processes that are available for control within the legal; political; institutional and attitudinal environment within which the technology is placed as a way of protecting our rights to life; liberty and pursuit of happiness. ,Appropriate for all,?

If you work with young children; you are not alone in your feelings! Increasing evidence suggests that an effective approach to addressing problem behavior is the adoption of a model that focuses on promoting social-emotional development; providing support for children’s appropriate behavior; and preventing challenging behavior. In this class; you will learn a framework for addressing the social and emotional development and challenging behavior of young children. The overarching goal of this course is to learn evidence-based practices to support the social and emotional development of infants and young children. We will read current research on the developmental trajectory of children with early-onset aggressive behaviors; positive behavior support program models; and intervention efforts that promote positive early childhood mental health. Evidence-based classroom management skills will also be studied and you will leave the course with a solid understanding of how to design supportive environments. This course incorporates a community with which you can learn from others; share your own current approaches and discuss your attempts to incorporate the learnings of this course into your early childhood practice. When you have finished this course; you will be able to: Identify the developmental stages of social emotional development from infants to young children. Identify adult child interactions that are emotionally supportive and that build positive relationships. Describe classroom management skills that prevent challenging behavior and increase active engagement in early learning. Observe and record a functional behavior assessment of a child in an early care setting. Write an individualized behavior support plan based on findings from the functional behavior assessment. Enact evidence-based adult-child interactions that prevent challenging behavior and increase social competence and for young children.,Appropriate for all,?

Rostain,It is estimated that 5-8% of school-aged children and 4% of adults in the United States suffer from some form of attention deficit disorder and that the incidence of the disorder is increasing in the population. Although it is the most widely studied behavior disorder of childhood; its etiology remains unclear; its outcome is variable; and its treatment is complex and moderately successful. Advances in neuroscience have provided new insights into the pathophysiology of ADHD; pointing to key neural circuits involved in attention; behavioral control; learning; and reward maintenance that appear to be underperforming in patients with the disorder. Moreover; the etiology of this heterogeneous disorder points to the key role of genetic and environmental interactions during prenatal and perinatal periods. Over the past decade; new diagnostic and interventional approaches have enabled clinicians to better diagnose and treat ADHD across the lifespan; while longitudinal studies have elucidated the long-term impact of the disorder on health and adaptive functioning. This course is intended for students with a background in psychology and/or neuroscience who are interested in learning more about the complexities of ADHD from both scientific and clinical perspectives. Scientific topics covered include prevalence and epidemiology; diagnostic criteria; clinical presentation at different ages; impact on development (intellect; academic; speech and language; emotional self control; motivation and executive functioning); health outcomes (risk taking; accidents; injuries; driving difficulties; unintended pregnancy); co-existing conditions (anxiety; mood; substance use disorders); and etiology (genetic; pre/perinatal; neurodevelopmental; neuroanatomic; neuropsychological).

By the time that I was five; my asthma had become life threatening. I spent many; many nights suffering with asthma. Did you know that when you are unable to get enough oxygen that your body will begin to shut down; and possibly destroy parts of the body that you don’t need to live? By the age of six; I had learned this fact by living through it many times. Unless you have ever experienced it; you don’t realize how very important remaining calm is during a serious health problem until you have experienced it. Stress; anxiety; worry; fear; anger; depression and many other negative emotions trigger certain biological responses within the human body. By the time I was seven years old I realized that if I could remain calm during asthma attacks; then the attacks would be shorter and not as devastating. So what is the best way to remain calm when your lungs are becoming so constricted that every breath is a painful struggle? That’s easy; meditation. Fortunately for me; my mother had recently learned about meditation and was able to teach it to me. However; I quickly realized that when an asthma attack is starting you don’t have a lot of time to meditate. So I studied different techniques; refined the systems and discovered ways to streamline it until I had a meditation technique that is fast; easy and extremely powerful; and that’s what I’m going to teach you in this course. Although I developed my meditation technique to save my life; I quickly realized that it was improving every aspect of my life. I was Calmer More Relaxed Stress Free More Productive Having Greater Creativity Seeing Better Relationships Improving Every Part of Life This meditation technique is compatible with all religions; and with those who practice no religions. I have taught it to hundreds of people over the years and they all have found that it is easy to use; something that can fit into their busy lives every day and; after a year; they all have reported amazing results.

Despite striking advances in information technology; clinical problem solving has not yet been effectively replicated by computers; making it essential that clinicians work to develop expertise in this very important skill set.  While television shows make this seem like a magical process; work done by cognitive psychologists and medical educators has helped us understand the ways in which expert physicians reason through these difficult problems to help their patients.   This course will examine the ways physicians think about clinical problem solving and will help participants develop competence in the building blocks of clinical problem solving. The professor will use cases to illustrate different reasoning strategies and will discuss how both correct and incorrect diagnoses result from these strategies. Participants will use sample clinical cases to practice what they have learned through the lectures. Finally; the professor will discuss strategies to help students and young physicians read textbooks and articles in a way that enhances their ability to use information in the clinical environment. ,Appropriate for all,?

But it can soon become overwhelming. So many requirements; regulations. And that s even without assessing whether we have a marketable idea and whether it will create the kind of success we really want. From idea to implementation This course is designed to cut through all of that and to take you on a thirty day journey from inspiration to income. I want to take your desire and your passion and show you how to turn it into practical actions that allow you to come up with profitable business ideas and your passion and to create income before the month is over. Accessible training in bite sized chunks Day by day; step-by step; this course will strip away much of the overwhelm you may feel as a new entrepreneur. It will take you on a journey from coming up with profitable business ideas;  discovering where your talents lie; to testing and packaging what you are going to sell; and to show you how to actually make money now. You need to check out your idea against these three criteria There are so many books and courses for new businesses and coming up with profitable business ideas. Books that tell you about business plans and accounts. But before you start to pull together these processes; you need to know that you have: 1  Profitable business ideas fit for you 2  a business that is a fit for the life income you want to create 3  something that people want to buy! Shortcut your success I work with clients who sometimes find years later that their business might be successful financially but they want to get out and so something they love. Or they have a great idea but they just can t make money with it. Or they have a business that runs their life; rather than a business that gives them the life they want. I don t want this for you. I created this course so that you could shortcut this journey. Yes you will need the right legal and financial framework. But you must also build your business on a foundation that will give you the fulfillment; the life and the income you want. Check you are on the right track right from the start This course shows you how to understand and rigorously test your profitable business ideas so that you know you are on the right track before you start (or to help you get re-oriented when you ve hit a roadblock!). This is for you if... This course is for you if you want to start a business doing what you love. If you want to feel fulfilled by what you do. And you want to create a lifestyle that works for you. This course is for you if you ve already started a business but you re feeling as if you didn t take the right path. Or if you know that you ve found your passion but you re struggling to turn it into income. Or if you simply want to know how to do the things that will move you forward day by day. Because it s the staying in action that gets results for you. Get Momentum: Start A Business You Love combines motivation with real; practical; actionable strategies. Anyone who is running a service business or a is a solo-preneur will find it especially valuable - creatives; coaches; consultants; designers; healers... This is designed for you. We ll cover: ?  How to build a business from your strengths - because this will make you more successful ?  Why people buy what you re selling and why are will buy from you ?  How to do the  five minute money check-in  (do this before you make important decisions!) ?  How to create income before the course is over ?  Why knowing your revenue model will help you know how to grow your business ?  Measuring success an easy way to monitor the numbers you need to pay attention to ?  How to take one step at a time to achieve your ambitions (hint: I tell my clients I can get rid of 80% of the things on their to-do list and this technique will help you do that too) ?  Identify and know how you are going to achieve your money goal (with downloadable spreadsheet) ?  Where to begin delegating even if you think you can t afford it yet ?  Three very simple questions that will help you stay on track when the course is over Practical actions And the best part is that this course isn t just about learning. It s about practical actions. Every day you will take an action step that is relevant and specific to you and your profitable business ideas.

This course is designed to teach web developers what they need to know to create great cross-device mobile web experiences. This course will focus on building mobile web apps; which will work across multiple platforms including Android; iOS; and others. What Will I Learn? After completing this class; you’ll have built a web application with a first-class mobile experience. You’ll understand what it takes to build great web experiences on mobile devices; have gained experience with the tools you need to test performance; and be able to apply your knowledge to your own projects in the future. What Should I Know? This course is for experienced front-end web developers who’d like to learn what it takes to create great mobile experiences. In order to succeed in this class; you should be comfortable with HTML; CSS; and Javascript; and should have experience creating web apps; either professionally or for fun. You don t need to know any specific HTML5 extras or APIs; we ll cover any of those that we need as the course progresses. Syllabus In this course; you will learn how to build web experiences that adapt to the different screen sizes and capabilities that mobile devices offer; and how to scalably optimize media for mobile and desktop. We will cover programming touch interaction; as well as how to optimize form field input for mobile devices and use APIs like geolocation and the accelerometer; and ensuring your web experiences work great when network conditions are sub-optimal. Finally; you’ll gain the tools to investigate performance in mobile applications; with a strong understanding of mobile networking; battery usage patterns and optimizing paint techniques to build smooth animations on mobile. Lesson 01: Syllabus We’ll start with a high-level overview of the course and what to expect in it. We’ll also go into more depth on what we mean by mobile web development; and why you should care about it. Lesson 02: Mobile Development Tools Workflow and tooling is incredibly important for building great web apps; and this carries over to mobile web development. This lesson will show you how to use the Chrome Developer Tools to develop for the mobile web. Lesson 03: Mobile UX and Viewport Designing for the mobile web is all about a smooth user experience. This lesson will get you thinking about how to achieve that on mobile; and we’ll introduce the first of many tools you need to achieve this: the viewport. Lesson 04: Fluid Design Mobile means lots of different devices and form factors. We’ll discuss how to make your site responsive; clean; and user-friendly on multiple devices and layouts. Lesson 05: Media Queries Sometimes different devices call for fundamentally different layouts. This lesson will teach you how to achieve this using media queries. Lesson 06: Responsive Images Media requirements are different in mobile - network constraints and very high resolution screens set up a conflict that can be challenging. We’ll talk about how best to integrate media into your mobile web applications; and adaptively scaling images based on the environment. Lesson 07: Optimizing Performance Users expect a fast; seamless experience on mobile. We’ll go over optimizing various performance metrics to improve that experience; such as network; cpu; rendering; and battery performance. Lesson 08: Touch Touch input is fundamentally different from mouse input; and requires you to think about your user interactions differently. We’ll go over UX concerns with touch-based interaction; and how to design user interactions that work across devices. Lesson 09: Input Using a keyboard on mobile is awful. We’ll discuss ways to improve it; using semantic input for form data; and other user input options on mobile. Lesson 10: Device Access Mobile devices have a full array of sensors typically unavailable on desktop. We’ll talk about camera access; geolocation; and other sensors and feedback you have access to on mobile. Lesson 11: Offline and Storage It’s an unfortunate reality that mobile users aren’t always online. We’ll go over using the local cache as well as local storage APIs to give your users a great offline (and partially-online) experience as well. Lesson 12: Wrap-up We’ll finish up the class by talking briefly about other topics to consider; such as app experience; monetization; deployment and distribution. We’ll also point you to other resources to look at moving forward in your career.,Intermediate,?

The course will be useful for students who plan to use experimental techniques as their approach in the laboratory and employ computational modeling as a tool to draw deeper understanding of experiments. The course should also be valuable as an introductory overview for students planning to conduct original research in modeling biological systems. This course focuses on dynamical modeling techniques used in Systems Biology research.  These techniques are based on biological mechanisms; and simulations with these models generate predictions that can subsequently be tested experimentally. These testable predictions frequently provide novel insight into biological processes. The approaches taught here can be grouped into the following categories: 1) ordinary differential equation-based models; 2) partial differential equation-based models; and 3) stochastic models. ,Appropriate for all,?

Among other things; a back-end let s you: Store data on a database Run CPU intensive tasks (such as face recognition) Provide a consistent API to read and write data Django is a Python-based web framework that provides a vast amount of plumbing to build a web-backend so that you don t have to do it. This will allow you to focus on building more and better features into your application without worrying about infrastructure and plumbing. Why this class? This is a project based class and will take a practical approach towards learning Django. By the end of the class you will be comfortable with the following: Setting up and Installing Django Interfacing with Databases using Django Models Writing basic Django templates Writing Django Forms Combining the above into a django app The final project will be writing a Personal Notes app. This app will expose you to many basic patterns which will be applicable to a wide variety of Django Apps. Although this is a beginner class I plan to introduce a few advanced Django concepts in theory so as to give you an idea of the power of the Django framework. This will also prepare you for job interviews that may ask you Django related questions. Why Django? Python - Need I say more? If you love Python; you will love Django Community - Django is supported by an excellent and supportive community. There are numerous Meetups as well as a Django Conference held every year Philosophy - Django is build around the design principles of Loose coupling; DRY; Less Code; Quick Development and Explicit is better than implicit.

Price: Free. Duration: 5 weeks.  Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Coaching Teachers: Promoting Changes that Stick ; Coursera; online Education courses,N/A,Online Course - Coaching Teachers: Promoting Changes that Stick,Coursera,Free,5 weeks,Yes,N/A,Teachers face a blizzard of decisions. Scholars estimate that teachers have over 1000 unique exchanges with students every day; most of which are unplanned and require quick decision making. And then there are the myriad daily decision points related to curriculum planning; assessing student work; and interactions with parents and colleagues. Amidst this frenzy; it’s easy for “bad” habits to set in; and hard to break them once they do. The question then becomes: How in such a fast-paced environment can coaches and instructional leaders help teachers execute changes in their practice that actually stick?  Effective teacher-coaches are not just knowledgeable about instruction; they’re also highly strategic in their approach to changing teachers’ behaviors. That starts with preparing teachers to receive critical feedback; and then continues with a careful selection of goals and scaffolds to ensure that feedback is implemented with fidelity. Oftentimes; teacher coaching suffers from a lack of direction; a lack of support; or both. The coach might tell the teacher to “Do X;” but then fail to articulate clear; measurable steps for implementation.  Most commonly; coaches can be overly suggestive; telling the teacher “You might do X; Y; and Z; and maybe even A; B; and C; too.” With an already very full plate; this approach leaves the teacher uncertain of what to focus on first; undercutting the likelihood of meaningful change. Even teacher coaching that’s described as “good” can sometimes fall short of resulting in meaningful change. The coach might see and say the right things; and the teacher might be very appreciative of the feedback. But unless the coaching drives true changes in behavior; the “good” in this case could actually end up being the enemy of effective. Match Education trains and employs dozens of coaches who provide intensive support for teachers in Boston and New Orleans. Course participants will be introduced to Match’s Five key principles of effective coaching; which strike the right balance between providing clear direction for teachers; while giving them the support they need to achieve their goals: 1)     Permission-based Coaching Teachers first need to permit themselves to receive coaching in order for meaningful change to occur. A skillful coach needs to know how to ask for and create buy-in for this level of permission. In this session of the course; we focus on concrete strategies that help teachers receive and process critical feedback; while maintaining a “growth mindset” about their practice. 2)     Shared Vocabulary and Vision A teacher coaching relationship must begin with a shared vocabulary for talking about instruction; and a common vision for what excellent teaching looks like. In this session of the course; we introduce a simple observation rubric and several video exercises that a coach could use with a teacher to communicate the parameters of what s/he will be looking for when s/he conducts classroom observations. 3)     Selecting and Setting Measurable Goals Novice teachers; in particular; often describe the feedback they receive from expert coaches as akin to “drinking from a fire hose” – there’s so much to work on that it becomes difficult to identify and prioritize next steps for their practice. In this session of the course; we focus on how to analyze classroom instruction and select a single; measurable goal that addresses a particularly high leverage aspect of a teacher’s practice. 4)     Delivering Directive Feedback We believe that teachers need to leave a coaching feedback session with absolute clarity about the steps they should take to achieve their goals. However; the clarity of those steps could easily be obscured by a coach who struggles to deliver candid feedback or to help the teacher articulate concrete; actionable solutions. In this session; we introduce and practice a protocol for debriefing a classroom observation that ensures that teachers have the direction they need to successfully implement a coach’s feedback. 5)     Create Opportunities for Practice Great coaches don’t just leave it to chance that a teacher is ready to implement feedback after merely discussing what to do. They first try to create opportunities for the teacher to rehearse or apply the action steps in the presence of the coach before the teacher attempts to do it in the classroom. In this session; we explore different exercises for practicing action steps within a coaching feedback session.  Course Learning Outcomes o   To describe and analyze strategies that help a teacher develop a growth mindset about accepting and acting on critical feedback. o   To describe and analyze tools (e.g. observation rubrics) that help teachers and coaches develop a shared vocabulary and vision about excellent classroom practice. o   To derive clear and measurable improvement goals for teachers based on observations of their practice. o   To describe and analyze protocols for delivering directive; actionable feedback to teachers. o   To describe and analyze exercises that generate meaningful opportunities to practice implementing feedback. ,Appropriate for all,?

Hard Knocks. Sleepless nights. Tears. Those are just a few of the ways that rookie teachers describe their first year in the profession. And those sentiments have been validated by countless research studies that show that students; on average; learn significantly less when they’re taught by rookies. Unfortunately; many educators believe this is a necessary “rite of passage” – a sort of hazing that one must experience on their path to effective teaching. We don’t believe that. Over the past 6 years; the Match Teacher Residency has developed and refined an approach to specifically address the challenges that are unique to the rookie teacher experience. In this four-week course; we’ll explore the three ideas that we ve found to contribute radically to success as a rookie teacher. “It s been a fantastic learning experience. I ve taken several Coursera courses and this one is definitely the most original and creative in its approach. I suppose its main advantage is the straightforwardness of teaching; clarity and impressive visual representation. Really looking forward to Part II; where rookie teachers may grow and develop their initial knowledge even further.” “This was my first Coursera course and it was really helpful; although I am a 12th year teacher. One can never say that he/she can manage the class successfully every day; every hour. All the advise was very much appreciated. Many thanks to all: Orin; Ross; and Kat. I await your next steps! “I am happy to report that it has come in VERY handy in my subbing jobs; in not only helping get the classroom management under control at the start of each period; but in keeping control for the rest of the period.  I even used it again yesterday; at another charter school where I sub only occasionally; and where the students are also a handful to manage.  I know the regular staff noticed and saw the effects.  So; it seems I m racking up points towards some good references when I do apply for a permanent position!  I have this course to thank for taking me from being an ‘adequate’ sub to being an ‘outstanding’ one!”,Appropriate for all,?

Can the “art” be relocated from the object crafted by an artist to the more ephemeral reaction of the viewer? Must an artist actually “make” a work of art at all? Conceptual artists recognized that when the 19th Century avant-garde broke with the academies and their emphasis on technical execution (the blending color or compositional clarity for example); they were freer to focus on more conceptual issues such as modern urban life; subjectivity; or pictorial language. Fast forward to the second half of the Twentieth Century when intellectual content became the defining characteristic of art and concept fully eclipsed craft. In the 1960 and 70s the art of Beuys; Haacke and others became increasingly conceptual. These artists used found objects; performance; and installation while de-emphasizing the act of “object making.”,Appropriate for all,?

El curso se restringe al conocimiento de algunos modelos matemáticos con los cuales quedará clara de un modo general la visión del Cálculo como la Matemática que estudia el cambio y la variación. En este sentido; la idea de derivada y su cálculo para diferentes tipos de funciones de una variable real forma parte del curso. A través del análisis de diferentes tipos de movimiento realizados por un “personaje” sobre una recta horizontal; la relación entre las gráficas de velocidad y de posición del movimiento con respecto al tiempo; aparecerán ante nuestra vista como la representación matemática que invita a interpretar lo que está sucediendo con el movimiento en cuestión. Algunos conocimientos algebraicos y geométricos que corresponden con ecuaciones y funciones lineales; cuadráticas y cúbicas van a ser retomados decididamente durante el curso; y esto para dar respuesta a diferentes preguntas que surgen del movimiento rectilíneo en cuestión. Será de este modo que se podrá interactuar combinando las diferentes representaciones matemáticas (numérica; algebraica y gráfica) en el afán por entender la situación real considerada. En este curso se hará un uso pleno de tecnologías digitales para la graficación y de software especializado en conocimiento matemático del cual se puede hacer uso de manera libre en la actualidad. Las prácticas que buscan consolidar el aprendizaje integran el uso de estos recursos también; brindando a la vez la oportunidad de ver en la tecnología digital un aliado en la interacción con la Matemática y nuestro pensamiento. El curso puede considerarse como una preparación al Cálculo en el nivel universitario; no obstante; busca ofrecer a cualquier persona un acercamiento a la Matemática diferente; donde números; letras; fórmulas y gráficas se entrelazan en un razonamiento coherente. Es una oportunidad para todo aquel que busca hacer del razonamiento matemático una forma de pensar y actuar.,Appropriate for all,?

Critical thinking is a key skill in the information age; valuable in all disciplines and professions. This introductory course will give you the opportunity to better understand what critical thinking is; and to practice and enhance your critical thinking skills. To do so; we will use the context of some important global challenges that affect us all; and to which we have no clear “correct” solutions: for example; the risk and spread of serious infectious diseases in epidemics in modern societies; the implications of increasing human population on global resources; energy; environment and climate; and the challenges of human health and wellbeing in the modern world. Possible solutions to global issues such as these are hotly debated; and give the perfect setting to practice recognizing and evaluating facts; ideas; opinions and arguments. The relevant background information for each global challenge will be provided to ensure that you can complete the exercises. Note; however; this course is not a course on these global challenges themselves; instead it uses the context of these thought-provoking challenges to practice critical thinking.

Duration: 6 weeks.  Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Analysis of a Complex Kind; Coursera; online Math and Science courses,N/A,Online Course - Analysis of a Complex Kind,Coursera,Free,6 weeks,Yes,N/A,Complex analysis is the study of functions that live in the complex plane; i.e. functions that have complex arguments and complex outputs. In order to study the behavior of such functions we’ll need to first understand the basic objects involved; namely the complex numbers. We’ll begin with some history: When and why were complex numbers invented? Was it the need for a solution of the equation x^2 = -1 that brought the field of complex analysis into being; or were there other reasons? Once we’ve answered these questions we’ll devote some time to learn about basic properties of complex numbers that will make it possible for us to use them in more advanced settings later on. We will learn how to do basic algebra with these numbers; how they behave in limiting processes; etc. These facts enable us to begin the study of complex functions; and at this point we can already understand the basics about the construction of the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets (if you have never heard of these that’s quite alright; but do look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set for example to see some beautiful pictures). When studying functions we are often interested in their local behavior; more specifically; in how functions change as their argument changes. This leads us to studying complex differentiation – a more powerful concept than that which we learned in calculus. Don’t worry! We’ll help you remember facts from calculus in case you have forgotten.  After this exploration we will be ready to meet the main players: analytic functions. These are functions that possess complex derivatives in lots of places; a fact which endows these functions with some of the most beautiful properties mathematics has to offer. We’ll explore these properties! Who would want to differentiate without being able to undo it? Clearly we’ll have to learn about integration as well. But we are in the complex plane; so what are the objects we’ll integrate over? Curves! We’ll study these as well; and we’ll tie everything together via Cauchy’s beautiful and all encompassing integral theorem and formula.    Throughout this course we ll tell you about some of the major theorems in the field (even if we won t be able to go into depth about them) as well as some outstanding conjectures.,Appropriate for all,?

If you have existing ASP.NET Web Services you are trying to support; you may have realized that it can be difficult to find good information about using them today. In this course you will learn the basics of ASP.NET Web Services and how to use them. We ll start off by talking about the technology and learning about how ASP.NET Web Services work. Then; we ll dive in and create our own simple ASP.NET Web Service and learn about how the technology works. Once we have a web service built; we ll learn how to use .NET s proxy generating utilities to create a consumer for our web service without writing much code. After that; we ll learn how to use ASP.NET Web Service in an existing ASP.NET application to provide AJAX functionality and even see how we can embed service methods in ASPX page.

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Web Application Architectures; Coursera; online Technology courses,N/A,Online Course - Web Application Architectures,Coursera,Free,6 weeks,Yes,N/A,This course explores the development of web application architectures from an engineering perspective.  We will consider the fundamental design patterns and philosophies associated with modern web application architectures; along with their major components.  By the end of this course; I expect you to be able to: Design; develop and deploy a modern web application.  This course is not about how to build a pretty web page; it s about how to build and deploy the full stack of protocols and technologies associated with a complete web app.  That said; it is not possible for you to become an expert in this area in a few weeks. My goal; rather; is to put you on the right path by providing a solid foundation and framework for understanding web applications; allowing you to dig deeper and learn more on your own. The next bullet points describe how we re going to do this. Understand the major architectural components in web apps; and how they fit together.  Modern web apps are complex.  A typical application has a database along with numerous scripts on one end of the web stack; a web server in the middle that delivers information over the Internet; and a user s browser on the other end of the web stack.  Even getting started in trying to understand these components can be overwhelming. Consider just the programming languages involved in a typical web stack: from the database (SQL); to the web server (scripting language); to the browser (JavaScript; HTML; CSS); we re dealing with five different programming languages; not to mention the protocols they re operating over – and you need to know a little about them too! We ll introduce a number of software design patterns throughout the course that are aimed at helping you to manage this complexity. Use Ruby on Rails.  We re going to learn about web apps through the Ruby on Rails framework.  Rails is a framework for creating web applications that is built on top of the Ruby programming language. I believe this is one of the best frameworks for learning about web applications; and it s also proving highly successful as a platform for commercial offerings.  That said; there are many other frameworks available; and the concepts you will learn using Rails are transferable to these other frameworks. Better understand modern software engineering practice.  We’ll be using the latest tools and practices in software development; source code control; testing; and application deployment. This will include exposure to agile development practices; the numerous tools that software engineers are expected to know how to use; and the cloud-based resources that are becoming increasingly important in web applications.      ,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Exploring Quantum Physics; Coursera; online Math and Science courses,N/A,Online Course - Exploring Quantum Physics,Coursera,Free,8 weeks,Yes,Charles W. Clark and Victor Galitski,Quantum physics is the foundation for much of modern technology; provides the framework for understanding light and matter from the subatomic to macroscopic domains; and makes possible the most precise measurements ever made.  More than just a theory; it offers a way of looking at the world that grows richer with experience and practice.  Our course will provide some of that practice and teach you  tricks of the trade  (not found in textbooks) that will enable you to solve quantum-mechanical problems yourself and understand the subject at a deeper level. The basic principles of quantum physics are actually quite simple; but they lead to astonishing outcomes.  Two examples that we will look at from various perspectives are the prediction of the laser by Albert Einstein in 1917 and the prediction of antimatter by Paul Dirac in 1928.  Both of these predictions came from very simple arguments in quantum theory; and led to results that transformed science and society.  Another familiar phenomenon; magnetism; had been known since antiquity; but only with the advent of quantum physics was it understood how magnets worked; to a degree that made possible the discovery in the 1980’s of ultrastrong rare-earth magnets.  However; lasers; antimatter and magnets are areas of vibrant research; and they are all encountered in the new field of ultracold atomic physics that will provide much of the material of “Exploring Quantum Physics”. Richard Feynman once said; “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.”  We say; that’s no reason not to try! What Feynman was referring to are some of the “spooky” phenomena like quantum entanglement; which are incomprehensible from the standpoint of classical physics. Even though they have been thoroughly tested by experiment; and are even being exploited for applications such as cryptography and logic processing; they still seem so counterintuitive that they give rise to extraordinary ideas such as the many-world theory. Quantum physics combines a spectacular record of discovery and predictive success; with foundational perplexities so severe that even Albert Einstein came to believe that it was wrong.  This is what makes it such an exciting area of science!,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,The Modern and the Postmodern; Coursera; online Humanities courses,N/A,Online Course - The Modern and the Postmodern,Coursera,Free,14 weeks,Yes,Michael S. Roth,In this course we shall examine how the idea of  the modern  develops at the end of the 18th century in European intellectual history; and how being modern (or progressive; or hip) became one of the crucial criteria for understanding and evaluating cultural change during the last two hundred years in the West. We shall be concerned with the relations between culture and historical change; and our materials shall be drawn from a variety of areas: philosophy; the novel; and critical theory. Finally; we shall try to determine what it means to be modern today; and whether it makes sense to go beyond the modern to the postmodern. The Modern and the Postmodern traces the intertwining of the idea of modernity with the idea of art or culture from the late 18th century until the present. Beginning with the Enlightenment; Western cultures have invested heavily in the notion that the world can be made more of a home for human beings through the development of culture (and technology). Throughout this period there has also developed a strong; sophisticated counter-movement that sees the Enlightenment effort as a disaster – destructive of both art and of the world. The Western idea of modernity is linked to but not the same as the idea of modernism. We will examine both in this class and then consider postmodernism in relation both to the philosophical idea of modernity and to the aesthetic considerations of modernism. This course covers a lot of ground; historically; conceptually and aesthetically. There is much to read; and very different kinds of reading: from philosophy to novels; from theory to poetry. Not all students will like all the reading; but if you digest it all; you should have a clearer sense of the cultural history of our present. Students should develop a historical; literary and philosophical understanding of some of the key themes of modernity and modernism in the West. They should learn to read classic and contemporary texts for their arguments; beauty and pertinence. They should see why these texts are “good to think with;” and; it is hoped; they will develop an appetite for further study in the areas covered by the course.,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Think Like a Philosopher; Udemy; online Humanities courses,N/A,Online Course - Think Like a Philosopher,Udemy,$20,6 hours,Yes,Kevin Browne,At this point you may be asking yourself: What does philosophy have to do with me? This is a common question for students to ask especially after a brief exposure to some of the concepts in philosophy. However; philosophy has a direct bearing on much of everyday life. Let s look at it in terms of the major questions we ll address in this course. Is knowledge innate or learned from sense experience? If you have children this question and the search for an answer has direct bearing on your life since the question has major implications for education. Nearly every educator has been a philosopher or influenced by a philosopher for whom this was an important question. The origin of knowledge and how it is acquired is important to know or have some idea about if you are at all concerned about effective education. For adults the question has bearing as well in terms of being able to learn new things. In an economy drive by information and information technology how we process this information is directly relevant to our everyday lives. So; philosophers like John Locke; Immanuel Kant; and John Dewey who investigate this question are also relevant. Is the mind independent of the brain? Philosophers and scientists have been investigating the mind; the brain; and their interaction for centuries. We ll see many competing theories on this question but how is any of this relevant to you? One very big word can answer that: psychopharmacology. Do you or anyone you know take some medication for ADHD; ADD; depression; bipolar disorder? If so; then questions about how the mind and brain work and interact are directly relevant to your everyday life not to mention your overall mood; happiness; and general mental state. These drugs could not have been discovered and developed without some idea about how the mind and brain worked. While these may seem like exclusively scientific questions; much of the work in the area of neurology has been done and continues to be done by philosophers. Some of the philosophers we ll look at in this area include Rene Descartes; Thomas Hobbes; John Searle; and J.J.C. Smart. Is there an objective reality independent of appearance and perception? This question sounds very esoteric and perhaps far removed from and irrelevant to everyday life. But; like most philosophical concepts; relevance lurks just below the surface if you know where to look. Many of you may be familiar with the prayer of serenity: God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference. Embedded in this prayer is the notion that there is a difference between what you can change and what you cannot. This is simply the distinction between objective reality and perception. Though not all philosophers we ll study agree that there is a difference between the two; the notion that there is a difference is the basis of at least one major school of philosophy called Stoicism. The notion that there is a difference between what you can change or control and what you cannot is a central idea in Stoicism and as such has formed the philosophical basis for much of self-help psychology. One consistent piece of advice contained in almost every volume of self-help literature is the importance of recognizing this distinction. Is there a God? For many of you this will be one of the easiest questions to relate to everyday life especially if you practice some form of religion. But; it may also seem irrelevant since you may be thinking that it can only be answered by faith and therefore is not worth asking. But; these sentiments themselves are philosophical in nature and bear examining (which we will do!). One philosopher we ll be studying named Thomas Aquinas pointed out that the question of God s existence is fundamental to every other religious question one can ask. If God s existence cannot be established the remaining religious questions are moot. At the very least an examination of the historical ideas related to these questions might be enlightening and lead to a deepening of one s religious sentiments. My purpose in this class is not to tell you what to think. I want to show you how to think philosophically but I do not want to change your beliefs. Philosophy may challenge them but it need not destroy them. In fact; you may find that it will strengthen them. So I invite you to enter the world of philosophy!,Appropriate for all,?

Why do some struggle academically while others excel at school despite minimal study? Why do some suffer the ravages of a psychotic illness like schizophrenia while others enjoy a life free of mental illness? At the core to answering these questions is the ages-old  nature-nurture  debate: Are the behavioral differences among us due predominantly to inborn natural differences or the cumulative impact of our experiences? The nature-nurture debate generated much controversy and acrimony within psychology; although today most are willing to retire the debate and declare both sides victorious. This course provides an introduction to behavioral genetics; the field within psychology that demonstrated that Nature and Nurture both play a fundamental role in the development of psychological traits. We will explore how early behavioral genetic research radically changed how psychologists conceptualized human behavior and how the mapping of the human genome is fundamentally altering current research approaches to a wide range of behavioral characteristics. The course will cover the traditional behavioral genetic methodologies of twin and adoption studies as well as modern approaches based on molecular genetic techniques. Upon completion of the course; students should have a basic understanding of how behavioral genetic research has changed psychology’s view of human behavior; the strengths and limitations of traditional behavioral genetic methodologies such as twin and adoption studies; the behavioral genetic approach to psychiatric phenotypes (to be illustrated by schizophrenia) and psychological phenotypes (to be illustrated by intelligence); and the structure and function of the human genome and the prospects for identifying the specific genetic variants underlying individual differences in behavior.,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Principles of Macroeconomics; Coursera; online Business courses,N/A,Online Course - Principles of Macroeconomics,Coursera,Free,8 weeks,Yes,Nilss Olekalns,In this course; we will examine the main bodies of economic theory that have been used to guide economists’ and policy makers’ understanding of the macroeconomy. Macroeconomics is a word derived from the Greek prefix “makros”; meaning large. It is the study of economic aggregates; of national and international economies and of the economic management role played by governments and international organisations. The founder of modern macroeconomics; the British economist John Maynard Keynes; famously wrote “The ideas of economists and political philosophers; both when they are right and when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed; the world is ruled by little else. Practical men; who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences; are usually slaves of some defunct economist.” This will be the key theme we explore in the course; the influence of theory and the way that policy responses to events like recession; unemployment; inflation and the Global Financial Crisis; reflect that theory. We will cover important macroeconomic concepts such as the national accounts; unemployment and inflation; explain how the ideas associated with John Maynard Keynes laid the foundation for governments’ active management of the macroeconomy in the post war era; and examine the intellectual basis for the monetary and fiscal policy responses to the Global Financial Crisis.  Economists’ approaches to the analysis of long run economic growth will also be considered. The approach will be critical. There are few areas of human endeavour that attract so much debate and disagreement as the management of a modern industrial economy. We will not shy away from those debates. But what we will do is emphasise the systematic theorising that underlies the way macroeconomists and policy makers approach their task. The aim is to enable those who take the course to become informed analysts of the macroeconomy and of current (and past) macroeconomic policy debates.

We focus on how social relationships and institutions -- such as familial relationships; national policies; and global economic forces -- promote or undermine the health of populations. The course covers existing evidence of health disparities; research methods; and theories relevant to the topic. The course is interesting because it reveals the so-called fundamental causes of disease and health disparities recognizable within social groups. For example; we examine why a flu germ can affect whole groups of people differently. In short; the course challenges the notion that health is a narrowly defined medical problem. Students in the course will listen to lectures; read provided materials; and complete quizzes and tests that examine comprehension and one s ability to synthesize ideas. Upon completion of the course students should: have a deep appreciation for how social arrangements impact the health of populations; be able to critically evaluate the scientific and popular health literature that address the causes of disease; be able to measure key social drivers such as race and socioeconomic status; and  be able to conceive of research strategies that can answer questions critical for policy making.,Appropriate for all,?

Scandinavia has a strong film and television culture with institutions and traditions created to secure creative diversity for both national; Scandinavian and global audiences. In many ways Scandinavian film and television is a global cultural brand; connected with and exporting some of the cultural and social values connected to a liberal and progressive welfare society. Dating back to the silent cinema era and through the birth of a modern film and television culture after 1945 Scandinavia has contributed significantly to our global cultural heritage. This course in Scandinavian Film and Television deals with the social; institutional and cultural background of film and television in Scandinavia and in a broader European and global context. The course will offer a deeper understanding of the creative forces behind film and television; of how Scandinavian society and culture has influenced the production. The course will deal with the co-production in Scandinavia and the role of Scandinavian film and television internationally. Theoretically the course will deal with national and global cinema; with film and media sociology; with genre and auteur theory and with film and media policy. The course will also deal with some of the most important film directors and film and television genres and the way they have reflected and influenced our understanding of Scandinavia and the image of Scandinavian culture and society abroad. From Carl Th.

Ethical Hacking is PREVENTATIVE Hacking Everybody knows what hackers are: bad guys — criminals — who find and exploit vulnerabilities within computer systems for financial gain; who learn and divulge secret information; and who sometimes corrupt systems just to prove how computer-savvy they are. Lot of crazies out there and some of them are extremely advanced in cyber-terrorism. Ethical hacking is GOOD hacking; preventative hacking. An ethical hacker works on his or her own system to protect it; or works within an organization to make sure their networks and computer systems are secure. The ethical hacker uses the SAME methods and skills as the “unethical” hacker. Ethical hackers use the same sophisticated skills to discover and correct computer security vulnerabilities. The difference; of course; is ethical hackers help others; protect systems; work within the system; defeat unethical hackers from gaining access to classified info and systems that aren’t as secure as the developer may have thought they were. Shortcut to becoming a Certified Ethical Hacker An ethical hacker can become a Certified Ethical Hacker by taking and passing a certification exam.

Are you struggling with the question of how to quickly build a userbase for your product? Do you have no money to spend on marketing? This class is for you. In the past few years; a handful of people have emerged that have been able to hack growth for products; growing them from 0 to 10+ million users in a matter of months with little to no marketing (read lean marketing). They call themselves  growth hackers  and they built companies like Facebook; Dropbox; Zynga; LinkedIn; Pinterest and Appsumo to where they are today. A growth hacker is a rare combination: someone with the right marketing and technical skills who can come up with clever marketing hacks and also track their results. So where do you find this rare creature? You don t. They re being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for their expertise at startups and venture funds. But don t give up. You too can learn growth hacking and be a growth hacker. Growth hackers weren t born that way. They learned a unique set of skills by being in the right place at the right time; and with the right people. I wanted to figure out what those skills and secrets were. So I started reading up on all the growth hacks. Then I reached out to some of the most famous growth hackers and asked them to learn their secrets. And they told me! (Growth hackers love showing off.) You d be amazed at what I learned! Some of it is so effective and so easy to copy that I can t believe more people aren t doing it. Some of my best friends work at startups; and I see how much they struggle to get new users for their product. I started telling them about what I learned. One of them used growth hacking techniques to get 60k new users in 60 hours! So I took what I learned and turned it into a class teaching growth hacking. In this growth hacking and lean marketing class; you ll learn: The secrets of how the world s fastest growing companies got their first million users The lean marketing funnel and how it makes figuring out the right strategies easy (and best of all; you waste less money!) What tools only growth hackers know about for quickly building hacks with almost no time or experience necessary The most innovative growth hacks that could double your userbase literally overnight This class contains hours of video content; live sessions; case studies and over a dozen lean marketing strategies you can implement immediately. It s right for just about any level - from beginner to experienced; from entrepreneur to designer to coder to marketer.

By the end of this short course; you ll use the skills you ve developed to conceptualize and create your own app. To get you there; your instructors Samantha and Andy will first help you build an app that could be used to manage logistics at a music festival. Though this is a very specific app use case; the skills you learn will be applicable to just about any business app you’d want to develop. What Will I Learn? After completing this course you will have built your own web and mobile app. You will become familiar with the concept of abstraction and how to think about concrete problems in their most general sense -- a concept critical for all developers. In addition; you will learn how to map out a data model; create data visualizations; and automate manual processes after analyzing your abstractions. What kind of apps can you build? Well; Facebook uses a Salesforce app to manage their entire hire-to-retire process: collecting resumes; sharing feedback; making job offers; and developing talent. And the Obama 2012 campaign built apps to mobilize their vast volunteer network and visualize the pulse of the nation in real-time. What will you build? What Should I Know? Good news! You don t need any programming experience and you don t need to know anything about Salesforce. You ll learn the ins and outs of point-and-click development; so all you need now is an interest in building an app. One thing you should know: the skills you learn in this course are in high demand and will help further your career. Syllabus Overview In this class you’ll learn the basics of building apps with Force.com; a part of Salesforce Platform. These apps are typically business apps: they solve organizational and logistical problems. You probably wouldn’t use Salesforce to build a computer game (though you could!). There are two ways to build apps in Force.com: with or without code. This class will only cover the non-coding; point-and-click app building interface. But don’t be fooled! Building powerful apps does not require writing code. This class contains an introductory lesson; five primary lessons where you ll be building and learning (each of which has an accompanying problem set to practice your skills); and a final project where you ll put everything together. Lesson 0: What is Salesforce (15 mins) What is Salesforce Platform? What does it do? Why should I learn about it? What kind of jobs can I get after I learn how to use it? In this lesson; you’ll meet the instructors; get to know the class; and learn a bit about Salesforce in general. Lesson 1: Creating your First App (90 minutes) In this lesson you’ll get acquainted with Force.com and actually build the beginnings of your first app. You’ll get some experience taking a big problem (in this case; managing a music festival); breaking it into smaller parts; and representing those parts in Salesforce. As you do this; you’ll learn about the basic components of a Salesforce app and add some simple (but powerful) functionality to your app. More concretely; you’ll learn about: Salesforce Data: Salesforce represents data as objects; fields; and records. You’ll learn what these terms mean and build them into your app. Relationships: When the pieces of your app start communicating; interesting things can happen. In this lesson you’ll learn the basics of Salesforce relationship fields. Validation Rules: If you’ve ever incorrectly entered your credit card number into a website; you already know about validation rules. In this lesson; you’ll learn how to build them into your app. Formulas and Summaries: These tools let you easily keep track of quantifiable things like money spent; customers contacted; or tickets sold. In this lesson you’ll learn how to build these automated calculations into your app. Lesson 2: Building out your Data Model (90 mins) Behind every powerful business app is a well-planned data model (also known as a schema). In this lesson you’ll learn how to decompose a complex problem into its component pieces and then connect those pieces together with the appropriate relationship fields. The data model you build will serve as the schematic skeleton onto which you’ll build dynamic functionality in later lessons. The specific topics covered are: One-to-Many Relationships: These relationships let the pieces of your app talk to each other. In this lesson you’ll learn how and when (and why) to use master-detail and lookup relationships in the apps you build. Many-to-Many Relationships: You’ll learn how to use a junction object to add flexibility into your data model. Customizing the User Interface: Good apps should be easy to use! In this lesson you’ll learn how to configure the layout of your app to make sure the UI is simple and intuitive. Schema Builder: There are many ways to get things done in Salesforce. In this lesson you’ll start using the schema builder to understand how your app works. Data Loading: This is a convenient way to get lots of data onto your app at once. Lesson 3: Visualizing your Data (45 mins) No matter what kind of app you’re building; you’ve probably got some data that you want other people in your organization to understand quickly and easily. In this lesson you’ll learn how quickly communicate information with real-time data visualizations. Specifically; you’ll learn how to make: Reports: These let you gather related information into one place. These let you gather data according to specific criteria and display it in neat rows and columns. Charts: These let you graphically summarize the information in a report. Dashboards: Different people want access to different information. A dashboard is a collection of charts that give specific people in your organization exactly the information that they need in real-time. Views: Data is good; but sometimes you have too much. Views let you selectively and quickly display only the data you care about. Lesson 4: Adding Automation (45 mins) In this lesson you’ll think about how to use your app to automate manual tasks. You’ll learn how to use two important Salesforce tools: Workflows: There are situations where a series of steps need to happen in sequence: first do this; then do that. Workflows let you automate processes like these; such as sending an email; assigning a task; or updating a field. Approval Processes: You don’t want every job to be completely automated. Sometimes you need someone to step in and say “this looks good.” Approval processes add a human element to your automated tasks. Lesson 5: Make it Social. Make it Mobile. (45 mins) This is it. With a few clicks of the mouse you’ll make your app social and mobile. The tools you’ll use are: Chatter: This will let your users collaborate on the projects and records they work on together. Salesforce1: That web app you’ve been building this whole time? It’s actually a mobile app too. You’ll even learn how to quickly customize your mobile interface and add functionality for mobile productivity. Final Project: Build your own App (2-4 hours) By the time you get here; you will have already built a music festival management app. Now it’s time to take your own idea and turn it into a functional web and mobile app.,Beginner,?

Promoted by John Tukey; EDA focuses on exploring data to understand the data’s underlying structure and variables; to develop intuition about the data set; consider how that data set came into existence; and decide how it can be investigated with more formal statistical methods. If you re interested in supplemental reading material for the course check out the Exploratory Data Analysis book. (Not Required) What Will I Learn? You will... Understand EDA as a journey and a way to explore data Explore data at multiple levels using appropriate visualizations Acquire statistical knowledge for summarizing data Demonstrate curiosity and skepticism when performing EDA Develop intuition around a data set and understand how the data was generated. What Should I Know? A background in statistics is helpful but not required. Consider taking Statistics: The Science of Decisions prior to taking this course. Relavant topics include: Mean; median; mode Normal; uniform; and skewed distributions Histograms and box plots Familiarity with the following CS and Math topics will help students: Variable assignment Comparison and logical operators ( <; >; <=; >=; ==; &; | ) If else statements Square roots; logarithms; and exponentials Syllabus Lesson 1: What is EDA?

R will be our tool for generating those visuals and conducting analyses. In this lesson; we will install RStudio and packages; learn the layout and basic commands of R; practice writing basic R scripts; and inspect data sets. Lesson 3: Explore One Variable (4 hours) We perform EDA to understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers. Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set as we begin to make sense of a pseudo-data set of Facebook users. While the data set does not contain real user data; it does contain a wealth of information. Through the lesson; we will create histograms and boxplots; transform variables; and examine tradeoffs in visualizations. Problem Set 3 (2 hours) Lesson 4: Explore Two Variables (4 hours) EDA allows us to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models. In this lesson; we will learn techniques for exploring the relationship between any two variables in a data set. We ll create scatter plots; calculate correlations; and investigate conditional means. Problem Set 4 (2 hours) Lesson 5: Explore Many Variables (4 hours) Data sets can be complex. In this lesson; we will learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables. We ll learn how to reshape data frames and how to use aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information. Extending our knowledge of previous plots; we ll continue to build intuition around the Facebook data set and explore some new data sets as well. Problem Set 5 (2 hours) Lesson 6: Diamonds and Price Predictions (2 hours) Investigate the diamonds data set alongside Facebook Data Scientist; Solomon Messing. He ll recap many of the strategies covered in the course and show how predictive modeling can allow us to determine a good price for a diamond. As a final project; you will create your own exploratory data analysis on a data set of your choice. Final Project (10+ hours) You ve explored simulated Facebook user data and the diamonds data set. Now; it s your turn to conduct your own exploratory data analysis. Choose one data set to explore (one provided by Udacity or your own) and create a RMD file that uncovers the patterns; anomalies and relationships of the data set.,Intermediate,?

Frustration; dropout without completion; low self-esteem; longer timelines and higher costs are among the consequences of taking the wrong approach to learn a foreign language. The good news is there is another way to quickly and effectively learn a second language. You usually hear people saying that they can understand a lot more than they can speak. Do you know why? Well; language is a skill and not information. The only way you can develop a skill is by practicing and in this case that means repetition. You can be presented with information in form of grammar or explanations of sentence patterns and you can learn it; but that is only awareness; now you can recognize phrases or pattern or word sequences; but you cannot produce. The only way to develop your conversational skills is overlearning; i.e.; repeating patterns until they are embedded into your subconscious mind. Repetition is the key to become fluent in a second language and that is what this course is about: to make you a fluent Spanish speaker We keep the grammar at the lowest level and focus on overlearning. We will teach you how to become fluent in Spanish in no time. Remember that to speak like a native doesn’t mean to sound like a native but to think like a native. A native doesn’t need to think about what they need to say; they think about how to achieve their communication goals and they don’t need to think about which words to use; that is subconscious. That is the main objective of the course; to make you think like a native Spanish speaker. This one is the first part of a series of courses that we will release in the near future. The course is divided into 5 sections: 1.Spanish pronunciation 2.Basic grammar 3.Spanish irregular verbs 4.Basic sentences and useful phrases 5.Basic dialog with repetition-; substitution- and response drills. If you are in any of the following situations; then this course is definitely for you: - You need to learn to communicate in Spanish in no time to boost your professional career. - You are learning Spanish but you don’t make progress with your communication skills. - You are about to give up your Spanish course; you are frustrated - You are about to move to a Spanish-speaking country and want to quickly learn to communicate in Spanish. - You have learnt Spanish at a certain level but now you are in a Spanish-speaking country and don’t survive conversations. - You just want to learn to communicate in Spanish to have fun and enhance your culture and horizons. - You need an effective roadmap to learn to communicate in Spanish. If you decide to take this course you will receive more than 25 years of experience learning and teaching foreign languages (Spanish and German); surviving in multicultural environments and using the language skills to boost my professional career. Of course you also will have the advantage of combining my Spanish native skills with my professional education as a Linguist and expert in teaching a second language. There is much to learn from every section here; so work through them all in turn and make sure you extract the most benefit from them. The course is designed to be dipped into quite easily as well; so you can always refer back to it…….,Appropriate for all,?

There was increasing exchange during this period between artists in Italy and those in Northern Europe in terms of both methods and style; though the two styles remain distinct.

Facing competition forces firms to look ahead and anticipate developments: If my rivals are likely to react to a price cut; I will have to take the expected reaction into account. We focus on such instances of “strategic interdependencies” in real business situations. We will first study the basic concepts of game theory as a toolbox with which we will then analyze strategic “games” in real-life settings. Rather than a set of checklists of “how-to-behave” in a number of prespecified situations; this course will teach you to think about business strategy in a systematic and exciting - and ultimately more successful - way! We will use our toolbox to address and analyze different decisions firms take: How do price wars happen and when do they end? When should I enter a market in which firms currently make high profits? What makes strategic partnerships work? These are just some examples of the questions we will discuss during the course. By the end of the course; you should be able to apply the concepts to pretty much any business situation. This course is complemented by Advanced Competitive Strategy.,Appropriate for all,?

In the 15th Century; Venice was at the height of its power with colonies and a well equipped navy to protect its merchant fleet abroad. Its fabulous wealth financed the construction of sumptuous churches and palaces—and art to fill them. The city’s salty; humid air meant that frescos faded quickly and so in the late 15th century; artists adopted oil; a medium they had seen used on panels from the north. By the late 15th century; they had also adopted canvas as their support of choice and artists like Giovanni Bellini created some of the most subtle and engaging art ever made.,Appropriate for all,?

Adding a few tricks to your pet’s daily exercise routine can also help prevent boredom and create a more obedient dog that is less likely to be destructive when the family is out at work or school.

Sporting more than 259 million users; and some 3 million business pages; LinkedIn has grown into a behemoth that definitely deserves your attention. The question is; how? The answer to that question is found perhaps in the place where you start on LinkedIn: your profile. How to optimize your new LinkedIn profile to make it more marketable Like many of the other social media networks; LinkedIn is evolving as well; and what was once your profile is now a far more versatile tool. Let’s look at some of the many ways you can take advantage of this. Don’t treat it like Facebook – LinkedIn is a professional social networking site; and you need to reek of professionalism and credibility. The things you’d share on Facebook; even your Facebook business page probably aren’t the best choice here. Make your photos stand out – If you don’t already have a professional headshot; get one. The image can be bigger now; so make sure you are portrayed as you would be when meeting with a client; because you might be! Don’t be overly serious either; as you need to come across as someone likeable that they would like to work with. Work on your headline – Since you now only have 120 characters to work with; you need to consider carefully what you say here. You get to portray you brand; and inject your best keywords here as well. Drop links judiciously – While the only clickable links will be in your Contact Information which is somewhat hidden; you may want to mention your sites in your summary as well. They won’t be able to click to your site; but at least you’re represented there. Frame your focus – Consider your goals carefully here; and use your summary section to convey this. It’s now above the fold; so what you put here is important Craft your Contact Information carefully – This is all now available in the Contact Info tab. You need to think of this as your business card on LinkedIn; and treat it as such. You can add all the ways you feel comfortable being contacted; as well as your website links. Show your personality – Don’t leave out this part! People relate to people; not milestones on a resume. Weave your personality into your profile at every opportunity. Give LinkedIn users a glimpse of who you are; and give them a reason to contact you.,Appropriate for all,?

Duration: 1 hour.  Click to learn more and find similar courses.,How To Write Marketing Copy That Sells; Udemy; online Business courses,N/A,Online Course - How To Write Marketing Copy That Sells,Udemy,$24,1 hour,Yes,Eric Sutherland,A Business Is Only A Business If It Can Sell So you have a great product or a fantastic service. Unfortunately in today’s attention seeking world that by itself is not enough. The truth is that it’s not the best product that wins; it’s the one with the best marketing. Of course; if you want repeat business; you also need a great product! But how do you get that new customer to just try you out? Direct marketing still works; it’s just that people seem to have forgotten how to do it – or perhaps they never knew. Nowadays though; you are more likely to send out an email than a letter in the post. What you want is a marketing piece that gets prospects to pick up the phone or visit your website and buy from you. This copywriting course is for every small business owner that has struggled to put together a flyer; sales letter; email marketing piece or copy for their website. The answer is of course with great marketing material. And that’s why I put this course together. Don’t get me wrong; it isn’t going to turn you into a marketing genius. But what it could do is give you a structure around which to work for and some big “Ah Ha” moments as you look at your marketing material differently. The concepts it explains on how to write copy are applicable to: Direct mail Email marketing Flyers Brochures Web Site Copy Sales Video Scripts Advertisements Sales Presentations So do you want to build a brand or sell some products? Hopefully you want to do both! But too many college educated marketers focus on “Brand Building” rather than selling. The truth is a successful brand develops as a result of lots of sales to happy customers. So you need to focus on winning sales not marketing awards! And that’s what this copywriting course is all about – showing you the 20 components that goes into any sales oriented marketing material. Not every marketing piece contains all 20 though. But if you don’t know what should be in there; how are you going to decide what to leave out? 12 components relate to the structure and 8 to the content and how it should flow. By understanding how they fit together and support each other you can create any size of marketing material. The core content on how to write copy is in video format and lasts for an hour and a quarter. It is easy to follow because it is broken down into 9 separate videos: Video 1: Introduction To Copy Writing In this video we start by looking at what it is you are selling. Remember you don’t sell a product or service; you sell a solution to a customer’s problem. To get to the core of the problem you are going to create a couple of lists. From these you will be able to write copy that directly targets the core desire of your target market – you do have a target market don’t you? Video 2: The Ultimate Sales Formula All sales messages need to be wrapped around a simple 4 step sequence. Even though you can’t put the same amount of information into a newspaper advertisement as a direct mail piece; both still need to follow the formula if you are going to get results. In this video we will look at what the 20 components of great copy are. Knowing the formula and the purpose of the 20 components helps you to decide which bits you need to include for different marketing pieces. Video 3: Grabbing Their Attention Attention spans are getting ever shorter; so you need to grab your audience s attention straight away. This video explains the parts of your sales message that does just that. You need to get this bit right if you want your target audience to pay attention to the rest of your sales message. Just choosing the right type of headline could make a huge difference in your conversion rates; but it has to work with the elements that surround it. Video 4: The Body Copy Once you have their attention; then they are more likely to read the rest of your copy. This video takes you through the components that should be in your main body text and why they are there! Every great story has a beginning; middle and end. Well; the Body Text is the middle of your story! This is where you add information about the benefits your prospect will get and how your solution is their best option. Video 5: Social Proof Your Offer Imagine you are the first person to take this course. What do you look for? Customer reviews obviously. They are everywhere on-line these days. People want to know that they are making the right decision when they buy; so naturally they want to know who else thinks this is good. This video shows you how to embed social proof into your marketing. So once you have taken this course; why not write a review of it for me! Video 6: The Call To Action Having an effective “Call To Action” is the difference between sales and branding. Every marketing piece that you create has to pay for itself by getting a prospect to do something. That might be to buy straight away; or it may be to get them to visit your website or call you; so that you can continue the sales process. This video shows you how to create an effective call to action. Video 7: Story Time The best marketing campaigns have stories and characters that you can relate to. The story is about how someone just like your target customer had exactly the same problem and how they fixed that problem using your solution. By creating an effective character you actually build social proof and third party testimonials right there into your copy. Stories bypass our critical filters and let you get your message in at the unconscious level. This video will show you how. Video 8: Value and Risk You have to demonstrate through your copy why your customers should swap their money for what you have to offer. You begin by building up your value proposition; but that may not be enough. So you also have to assure them that their money is safe and that they are not taking any risks when they put their trust in you to deliver. Effective risk reversal could be the key to getting them to say yes; so this video explains how you build that into your copy. Video 9: Credibility And Framing This is the final part of the jigsaw. In this video we will explore how to create credibility in print and the importance of creating a contrast frame for your value proposition. The truth is that your customers don t care about you; they care about what you can do for them. But they need to be able to trust that you will deliver what you say you will; especially if this is the first time they have bought something from you. Get Started Today! I hope you will find the videos in this copywriting course informative and entertaining – after all it is much easier to learn something if it’s fun! At the end of each video you will have some homework to do! After all; you are learning this so that you can apply it to your business. Even if you pay someone else to create your marketing materials for you; this course will give you the information you need to have a professional discussion with them. And of course it comes with a full money back guarantee – I explain why in video 8 by the way! So why not get started today and start to make more sales by using better marketing copy? That way the course will have paid for itself in no time at all.,Appropriate for all,?

If you did; chances are good that you came of age before 1981 and are a member of the last generation of humans on this planet to be able to say that you remember those ‘carefree days when all you had to worry about was getting pregnant; herpes; and a bad reputation’ (AID Atlanta). On June 5; 1981 the CDC released a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report describing the first five cases of what later became known as the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome; or AIDS. On that day human history broke into two generations: Those who can remember a time before the AIDS pandemic and those who can t. No matter what generation you grew up in; what we all have in common is a curiosity about AIDS.  Where did it come from? Why is it so widespread?  Are we making progress towards a vaccine? What is it like to be part of a vaccine trial? Has anyone ever been cured of HIV infection? Are some people just naturally more or less susceptible to HIV than other people are? All of this and more will be covered in AIDS. Over the course of nine weeks we will discuss a wide range of issues; innovations; and controversies regarding HIV/AIDS in the US and around the world including everything from what circumcision and Truvada have in common; how school children in Africa are changing the way AIDS education is done; where you can go online to learn how many cases of AIDS there are in your area; and how one man’s insistence that AIDS doesn t exist left hundreds of thousands of people without access to life saving drugs.,Appropriate for all,?

Trainings are an easy and dynamic way of focusing people and sharing valuable experience.  They can mean the difference between a merely competent worker and a dedicated powerhouse who drives growth. No more Death by Powerpoint.  Unfortunately; many organizations settle for tedious lectures and slides during their orientations; killing a new hire s momentum and turning them off before they even start work. Keep those awesome people!  You work hard to find the best new talent and passionate people to join your organization.  Why put them to sleep on the first day with boring trainings and tedious orientations?   Train them the  WOW  way.  As dynamic and powerful as trainings can be; bad trainings can be just as effective - in a totally negative way - giving your hard-won new employees a lackluster attitude toward your mission. Rather than orienting them with poor quality training; you re probably better off not training them at all.  It s the opposite approach to the useless; time wasting; infuriating trainings I ve had to endure. With your approach I think people would actually want to have training and it would actually *gasp* train people  -Nancy Gough; online tutor  An excellent course about becoming a successful teacher... I highly recommend this course!  - Laurel Lampella; professor of education at UNM Win on Day One.  Now your company can deliver the high-energy kickstart that new hires crave on their first day; and you don t need to spend $10K in order to have a professional trainer.

This course will provide an entry into the complex world of modern mysticism; through studying its psychological thought. We shall begin with exploring the interpretations of mystical experience offered by psychoanalysts in the twentieth century; starting with Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung and ending with contemporary thinkers such as James Hillman. However; we will see that the European mystical traditions; including Kabbalah in the Jewish world and those of the Catholic; Orthodox and Protestant worlds; developed their own elaborate systems of psychological thought. Thus; we will mostly examine mystical psychology on its own terms. We shall especially look at two terms that are very much in use also in general culture: the heart (as an emotional rather than a physical center!...) and the soul; looking at the unique mystical concepts of their nature and destiny and asking if there were influences and meetings between the different religions.,Appropriate for all,?

Over the following weeks; we introduce complexities of the real world to this model: how greenhouse gases are selective about what light they absorb; how the temperature structure and weather in the atmosphere set the stage for the greenhouse effect; and how feedbacks amplify it. From this point on the exercises will be based on on-line interactive models for various aspects of Earth’s climate and carbon cycle; exploring the topics described in the video lectures.  We then turn to the carbon cycle of the Earth; how it stabilizes Earth’s climate on some time scales but destabilizes it on others. The fate of fossil fuel carbon will be determined by its integration into Earth’s ongoing natural carbon cycle. The class concludes with a look at the human impact on Earth’s climate: why we believe it’s changing; why we believe we’re changing it; the impacts that could have; and the options we have to mitigate the situation.,Appropriate for all,?

For the most part these presentations are a pain to put together; never look as beautiful as you d like; and take up way more time than you d like to spend. If you re a manager; it s stressful to train your team to produce presentations up to your standards and you probably don t have time to coach them all the way through. For presentation makers; it s a pain in the ass to keep iterating on the same deck over and over reacting to the whims of your superiors. It can feel like you re just spinning your wheels; spending tons of time making stupid adjustments to your deck. Or maybe you re a storyteller; an entrepreneur or someone who just wants more tools to communicate better visually. Whoever you are; these are the five essential tips that I ve picked up in my career preparing and presenting power points to my teams; my bosses; executive clients; etc. And tips I ve passed on to my teams and colleagues who ve wanted to step up their presentation skills. No better way to learn than to do; so we re going to learn all five skills by making two killer pages: A beautiful table of contents page A stunning quotes page By making these pages; we ll learn the following skills: Alignment and Distribution. How do we use powerpoint to quickly organize all our objects so they re all lined up and perfectly pleasing to the eye. Using Shapes with Text. How can we easily add color and structure to our text and pictures by placing shapes behind it. Managing your Colors. What s our strategy to get all of our perfectly aligned objects looking their best. Working With Pictures. Learning the many ways to get pictures into your presentations and how we can manipulate them once they re in there. Using Text with Images. How can use text over and around images to bring them to life. Bonus! A very very cool trick I ve learned just recently to make quotes come to life and look super well designed. You ll have to take the course to see the result. I guarantee you ll learn something or your money back. I mean; you have that lifetime money back guarantee anyways so what are you waiting for? The course should take you about an hour and is chock full of goodness. PS: this course is not meant to be comprehensive. The five skills are the first of many that I teach my students. For instance; making tables and charts are often  essential  for business; as well; but those topics are too large to cover in this snackable course. But if there s enough demand; we may cover it in its own course.,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Triple P Trading Course; Udemy; online Business courses,N/A,Online Course - Triple P Trading Course,Udemy,$17,2.5 hours,Yes,Billy Williams,William O Neil; publisher of The Investor s Business Daily and a legendary stock trader; did an exhaustive study back in the 1960 s on the winning traits of the stock market s biggest winning stocks and he found that there were common characteristics among runaway stock moves. One of the biggest discoveries were that high-performing stocks formed key price patterns before breaking out and making their investors rich. O Neil used that knowledge to achieve staggering returns which helped him gain a seat on the New York Stock Exchange while in his 20 s and also funded the start-up of the Investor s Business Daily which grew into a billion-dollar publishing empire. Expanding on O Neil s lessons;in the late 1990 s; a pool contractor named Dan Zanger broadened the use of key chart patterns just like you ll learn in this course and took a trading account from $11;000 to over $43 million dollars in just 18 months! It was an incredible feat that set records and was documented publicly by both his accountants as well as Forbes magazine. Now; for normal people; those results are not typical but his story stands as a testament as to what is possible once you understand the key principle of Dan s story which is - through dedicated study of the right information; Dan went from a losing trader to a massively successful winner by using price patterns! Price patterns are commonly talked about among traders but not commonly understood; and this causes alot of traders to miss out some truly epic trades. In this course; its my goal to make sure that this doesn t happen to you. Here; you ll learn: How to train your mind to spot high-performing price patterns and hone in with laser-like; almost psychic accuracy when spotting price patterns! Use  dynamic  entry signals where momentum screams that the dominant trend is about to drive price into a new profitable trend. Bullish patterns will have higher winning percentages than bearish patterns because bottoms are easier to call than tops. Why? Because of certain emotions at play (know this and you ll understand something so primal that you ll never trade the markets the same way again). If you can draw simple lines and connect the dots then you have the tools to find winning trades in today s stock market (and avoid losing trades as well). The truth about quiet; low-volatility stocks and how they can emerge as the next Apple Computer or Baidu.com; the kind of runaway moves that grow your trading account. Like a coiled spring; price may pull back slightly in order to explode forward and give you a small window of opportunity for a low-risk entry! But; you need to learn how to spot a First Stage Base (90% of traders get this wrong but; now; you ll be able to spot it in a glance and put yourself in a winning position as the trend resumes upward). How to use one trick to time your entries with incredible precision just as a runaway move is about to occur! How combining two simple indicators can show you explosive price points to put yourself in front of fast-moving stocks for 50%; 100%; 200%; or greater returns. The one sneaky trick that underhanded floor traders use against traders like you and how to avoid it and how to profit by turning the tables against them. Better than Trend-Trading: Trading trends is one of the most reliable methods for solid returns but; sadly; has a success rate of less than 1/3rd of the trades implemented (maybe less). However; using key price patterns along with sound technical criteria; you can have extremely high success rates that are potentially as great as 98% with some chart patterns. The simple reason why the  King of Momentum  patterns will fail. (and what you can do to avoid it while making effective trades which have more potential to profit instead) What you should look for when price emerges into expansion. What you should know about  Static Defense  versus  Dynamic Offense  when confronted on making an entry decision. The one thing you must never do when a stock breaks out of a period of contraction. The one type of trend you must never trade or you will never make money in the market! The simple fact is that  The Herd  is wrong more often than not and how to use this fact to spot trend reversals and avoid losses when the amateurs are piling on new positions at the WRONG TIME! (knowing this can help you profit when The Herd is too scared to act! Real fortunes are made this way in the stock market and how Warren Buffett; Paul Tudor Jones; Jesse Livermore; and George Soros became legends!) Do you feel frustrated or; worse; paralyzed with fear by not knowing which direction you should be trading a stock? Learn these 4 methods of filtering out price movement and you ll never experience those destructive negative feelings again. The reason why you should trade stocks at their all-time highs (and it has nothing to do with overhead resistance). Why the Yin/Yang concept of Chinese culture holds the true secret of unlocking the potential of price movement and how to use it to make high returns. The secret relationship between price and volume. Learn how Isaac Newton s First Law of Physics relates to price movement...and when it doesn t. The single most important indicator to help you detect tomorrow s monster moves (imagine catching Apple Computer 5 or 6 years before anyone else). 23 of the most profitable price patterns with detailed instructions on how to spot them; confirm their entry points; trade volume requirements; and success rate. You will understand price action and movement at its most fundamental level and be able to know when to trade; spot chart patterns; read the correct trend in play; avoid losing trade setups; and have the potential to increase your overall returns and take your trading to a new level of success with greater ease. Why the simple fact is that a strong technical trader will outperform a good fundamental trader and why. The secret of  Surfing Momentum  and how to use it to put yourself in front of a fast-moving trend (this makes price  prove  itself worthy of you making an entry or revealing that it isn t worth it and keeps you from ever getting into a losing position to begin with). And much; much more. In the Triple P Trading course; you ll get a fully detailed strategy guide that breaks down each chart pattern for you so that you fully understand how the pattern forms; its success rate; what to look for; and when to enter at the right moment. It is a blueprint to the best price patterns that have the highest success rate and lead to the biggest winning moves. You ll also get videos with case studies of the strongest chart patterns and how they apply to the stock market. In addition; you ll also get the audio lessons to each video so that you can listen to the lectures on your MP3 player whenever you want. The best part is that you ll have this material to view over and over again to really drive home the lessons they contain so that you can get better and better at using them.
