Click to learn more and find similar courses.,The Art of Public Speaking: Lessons from Great Speeches; Udemy; online Business courses,N/A,Online Course - The Art of Public Speaking: Lessons from Great Speeches,Udemy,$169,6.5 hours,Yes,The Great Courses,Everybody is a public speaker. Maybe you’re delivering a corporate presentation or interviewing for a new job. Maybe you’re a teacher lecturing students or a citizen addressing a neighborhood association. Maybe you’re arguing a case before a courtroom or persuading book club members about the merits of your latest read. Whatever the situation; being able to speak in public is essential to success. You can have the most logical argument possible; but in order to truly teach; inform; persuade; or defend; you need to present your ideas with conviction and confidence. Yet this is often easier said than done. Many of us have a deep fear of public speaking. Or we think it’s just an intuitive talent that can’t be learned. But according to award-winning Professor John R. Hale of the University of Louisville; a masterful public speaker who has delivered more than 1;000 speeches to all manner of audiences; that couldn’t be further from the truth. All it takes is confidence; practice; and the knowledge of time-tested techniques and strategies used by history’s greatest public speakers—all of which you’ll find in The Art of Public Speaking: Lessons from the Greatest Speeches in History. This 12-lecture course is your guide to the secrets of this essential skill; an insider’s look at what makes history’s enduring speeches so unforgettable; and an invaluable reference tool you can use any time you have to speak your mind. Learn from History’s Greatest Public Speakers As both a lecturer and a distinguished historian; Professor Hale has a strong awareness of how public speaking has been used effectively in the past. What makes The Art of Public Speaking such a unique educational experience is that you learn about the craft from some of the best public speakers in history. Each lecture features powerful speeches by iconic individuals that illustrate how the strategies of public speaking have been used in real situations. Here are some of the powerful voices you’ll meet: ·Abraham Lincoln; who defined the art of delivering a strong conclusion with his iconic Gettysburg Address ·Marie Curie; whose commencement address to Vassar College in 1921 exemplifies how to turn dry facts into captivating stories ·Martin Luther King Jr.; who illustrated the best way to share beliefs in his stirring “I Have a Dream” speech A Course Designed for All Speakers Explorations of public speaking are often bogged down in complex rhetorical terms. But Professor Hale has designed The Art of Public Speaking to be accessible to everyone. In order to do this; he takes you through each of the three key components of successful public speaking. ·How to prepare for public speaking: Learn from Patrick Henry; Elizabeth I; and others how to overcome stage fright; control your voice and body; use humor; and personalize your delivery. ·How to craft a great speech: Learn how to build captivating speeches from people such as Paul the Apostle and Susan B. Anthony and how to use stories; examples; logic; and impressive visual images. ·How to handle your audience: Learn from Mark Antony; Gandhi; and others how to focus on your audience; persuade them to agree with you; invite them to share your vision; and inspire them to change. Practical Advice to Help You in Any Situation The Art of Public Speaking; though rooted in rich history; is packed with practical advice. Here are just three of the tips you’ll find: ·Speak from personal knowledge: Use personal experiences to allow your audience to better connect with you. In polite conversation; talking about yourself is frowned upon; in public speaking; it’s essential. ·Organize your facts into a story: When drafting a speech; find the underlying stories in your topic and organize your information around these stories. You’ll find it easier to remember your speech; and your audience will engage more with your message. ·Weave familiar references into your speech: Using familiar quotations when addressing your audience can establish a common ground. They may not be your words but; when used sparingly; they can infuse your speech with added power. A Course that’s Informative and Inspirational Praised by both our customers and his students for delivering lectures that are informative and engaging; Professor Hale is the perfect instructor for a course on the power of public speaking. Each of his lectures is an example of lecturing at its finest; demonstrating firsthand the ability of a public speaker to tell stories; to inform; and to inspire. So join him on this invaluable and practical look at one of the most important skills in your personal and professional life. Whether you want to finally become the confident public speaker you’ve always wanted to be or are just looking for fresh advice on how to strengthen your public speaking skills; this dynamic course has everything you need. ABOUT YOUR PROFESSOR Dr. John R. Hale is Director of Liberal Studies at the University of Louisville in Kentucky and a practicing archaeologist with more than 30 years of fieldwork experience in England; Scandinavia; Portugal; Greece; Turkey; and the Ohio River Valley. He earned his B.A. from Yale University and his Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge. Professor Hale has received numerous awards for his distinguished teaching.

Sociology gives us the tools to understand our own lives and those quite remote from us. The premise of this class is that in order to benefit from the sociological perspective; we need to learn how to ask certain basic questions. We need to know how to seek answers through methods that strive to be systematic and generalizable.We will begin with some of the essential questions: How are the things that we take to be natural socially constructed? How do we live today? How determined is social life? Does the individual make a difference? How is social order possible? Then we will ask what techniques are available to make sense of these questions.  We will review comparative; historical; demographic; experimental; and ethnographic methods. Along the way; we will study core concepts including ethnocentrism; social networks; community; unanticipated consequences; social capital; race; class; and gender. We will strive to understand how interaction in micro-level contexts affects larger social processes and how such macro-level processes influence our day to day lives. We will learn to conceive of inequality by asking how race; class; and gender work in tandem. We will address one of the crises of recent sociology -- whether we can actually isolate the effects of social context. We will think about how social science is changing at a time when we are literally swimming in oceans of data generated by the internet.,Appropriate for all,?

N. Whitehead Elsewhere Whitehead points out how Plato pulled it off: by writing all the ‘heresies’ in advance. That is; whenever anyone says Plato was wrong—and how; and why—it turns out Plato himself said it first. (As P.T. Barnum said—but maybe Plato proved it first?—there’s no such thing as bad publicity. And the cover-up is usually worse than the crime. That s as true in philosophy as in US politics) In this course; students study Plato’s ancient art of blowing up your beliefs as you go; to make sure they’re built to last. We spend six weeks reading three Platonic dialogues (a bit like plays; in which we see two sides of an argument come to life.) Then; for two more weeks; we study a pair of footnotes. That is; we will consider some contemporary manifestations of issues Plato discusses. Our focus will be: moral theory and moral psychology.  It turns out: the more you blow up your beliefs; the more they stay the same (as I mentioned already). Why ‘Reason and Persuasion’? The title is generic; and indicates that the course will be - if this is what you are looking for - a general; introduction to philosophy; as it tends to be taught at the university level. But the title also points to a specific problem: reason without persuasion is useless; persuasion without reason is dangerous. Plato worried about it. So will we. The course will be of interest to a wide variety of students. There are a variety of reasons why you might want to know at least a little about what Plato thought and wrote. I will do my best to teach in a way that accommodates as wide a range of likely interests in the subject as i can manage.,Appropriate for all,?

This is a natural state and within the reach of all human beings. It comes from having satisfied all of one’s human needs.  This is the kind of happiness that cannot be obtained through the acquisition of things. The fleeting gratification in receiving goods or services is not true happiness. That is an illusion created by our global consumer society. I am not suggesting that you should avoid having nice things; just that they are not a source of true happiness.  Truly happy people are Self-Actualised (SA) people; so called because they are a much fuller expression of their unique human potential than non SA people. The state has been given many labels; enlightened or awakened being two of them. In Zen; it is described Satori.  While you cannot order happiness on demand; you can create the right conditions in yourself for Self-Actualisation to occur. This eBook describes what these conditions are; and how you might go about creating them. The rest is up to you.  Dr. David Tuffley; and experienced teacher and researcher takes you through a series of short videos that paint a portrait of the self-actualising person that you can learn from and emulate in your own life. If you take this course; follow its advice and put the principles into practice in your own life; you make it much more likely that you will experience true happiness.

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Measuring Causal Effects in the Social Sciences; Coursera; online Social Sciences courses,N/A,Online Course - Measuring Causal Effects in the Social Sciences,Coursera,Free,9 weeks,Yes,Anders Holm,In this course we discuss how to identify causal effect in the social sciences. Causal effects are interesting whenever we want to understand mechanisms. As an example we can think of the case of wage differentials across gender. This may be due to either discrimination from employers or differences in unobserved background characteristics across gender. Usually we would like to think about discrimination as a mechanism whereas differences in background characteristics would usually not been seen as a mechanism. So it may be important to be able to tell why there is pay differences across gender. To show causal effects the provision of a statistical relationship is not enough.  The fundamental problem in identifying causal effects is therefore a matter of research design and research strategy.

Stories about companies or scientists using data to recommend movies; discover who is pregnant based on credit card receipts; or confirm the existence of the Higgs Boson regularly appear in Forbes; the Economist; the Wall Street Journal; and The New York Times. But how does one turn data into this type of insight? The answer is data analysis and applied statistics. Data analysis is the process of finding the right data to answer your question; understanding the processes underlying the data; discovering the important patterns in the data; and then communicating your results to have the biggest possible impact. There is a critical shortage of people with these skills in the workforce; which is why Hal Varian (Chief Economist at Google) says that being a statistician will be the sexy job for the next 10 years. This course is an applied statistics course focusing on data analysis. The course will begin with an overview of how to organize; perform; and write-up data analyses. Then we will cover some of the most popular and widely used statistical methods like linear regression; principal components analysis; cross-validation; and p-values. Instead of focusing on mathematical details; the lectures will be designed to help you apply these techniques to real data using the R statistical programming language; interpret the results; and diagnose potential problems in your analysis. You will also have the opportunity to critique and assist your fellow classmates with their data analyses.,Appropriate for all,?

The best forex trading systems however combine a good win rate with a high ROI. Most forex scalping strategies rely on a high win rate to make a profit; but they have a very low ROI; they also need a huge amount of focus during the trading day and it is very easy to over trade. This is why very few forex scalpers are profitable traders. Yet the advantage of trading the lower time frames is that there are many more opportunities to trade. The High ROI Scalping System was created to solve the problems of most forex scalping strategies by providing a high ROI while still using the low time frames to trade and providing ample trading opportunities. This system also requires minimal screen time compared to most other forex day trading or forex scalping systems and is easy to understand.

So That You Can Take Complete Projects That Have Been Causing You Regrets... And Finally Get the Success You ve Wanted to Achieve! According to Harvard University researchers Matthew Killingsworth and Daniel Gilbert – “about 47 percent of people s waking hours are spent doing anything except being in the moment and focusing on the current activity…” Another current research study shows that over the past 30 years; procrastination at least occasionally has quadrupled with a whopping 95% of those polled. Also 52% procrastinate regularly with 20% of all students saying they are chronic procrastinators. This means you’re not alone; but it’s not good news either… Too many a time do we read general solutions about how to focus our mind.  However; we cannot truly tackle these problems until we look at you and how you tick.  Want to learn how you can finally tackle both yourself and your habits by digging into your own brain? There is really no ‘one size fits all’ solution until you can tackle YOURSELF. That s right; and that s what we re going to do in this video training course. Focus can be lost in many ways; and in this video training course you will learn how to focus your mind on how to get things done in relation to you and how you tick.</p></p>,Appropriate for all,?

When you are a SaaS owner like myself; crafting compelling copy is even more tricky because you don t have a product that you sell once: people need to come back to your website and buy it over and over again; each month. According to a Nielsen study:  While web users do scroll below the fold on websites; the portion of space  above the fold  still remains the most valuable; with 80% of users  time on sites spent in this area.  This means that if your web copy for your SaaS does not capture the visitor s attention in the first few seconds; you may have lost a potential client for good! What makes the  How To Present Your SaaS - Copywriting & Design Elements  course so special is the fact that we have explained the art of persuading people through copy by accessing emotional triggers and psychology elements that let you know what your prospects are thinking. Everything you will learn in this course is completely ethical and there no manipulation required. Amongst others; we are going to explain how the human mind works and how people respond to stories and emotions. We re also going to take you through a series of exercises and give you examples on how to apply the things you learn on your SaaS website. With 7 well-structured videos; you will learn the secrets behind creating a SaaS presentation website that people will love. The course is designed for SaaS owners; but copywriters can also get valuable stuff from it; like: - how to create amazing stories that capture people s attention - how to create title; subtitles and value propositions that suck people in - how to gather testimonials and use them at their maximum efficiency,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,The Inexplicable Universe: Unsolved Mysteries; Udemy; online Math and Science courses,N/A,Online Course - The Inexplicable Universe: Unsolved Mysteries,Udemy,$99,3 hours,Yes,The Great Courses,Everything we now know about the universe—from the behavior of quarks to the birth of entire galaxies—has stemmed from scientists who’ve been willing to ponder the unanswerable. And with the advent of modern science; great minds have turned to testing and experimentation rather than mere thought as a way of approaching and grappling with some of the universe’s most pressing and vexing dilemmas. So what is our latest picture of some of the most inexplicable features of the universe? What still remains to be uncovered? What are some of the next avenues of exploration for today’s chemists; physicists; biologists; and astronomers? Pondering the answers to these and other questions is a great way to ·appreciate the grandeur and complexity of the world around you; ·better understand and discuss news and developments in science; and ·spark further interest in some of science’s many exciting areas of study. “We know a lot about the universe. But there’s even more that we don’t know;” says astrophysicist and Professor Neil deGrasse Tyson; director of the Hayden Planetarium; an award-winning lecturer; and one of the world’s foremost experts on the secrets of the universe. And his course The Inexplicable Universe: Unsolved Mysteries is the perfect gateway into this mind-bending and eye-opening subject. This visually stunning course; which has been honored with a 2013 Telly Award for Outstanding Educational Program; features six self-contained lectures that transport you on a marvelous journey to the frontiers of the known (and unknown) universe and introduce you to tantalizing questions being addressed by the world’s top scientists. Undeniably engaging and fascinating; this lecture series is a wonderful entrée to scientific pursuits that lie at the very heart of the history and nature of our universe. An Informed Scientific Conversation Central to The Inexplicable Universe is the way it takes you deep into hidden layers of the universe in a manner that is extremely accessible. Rather than a stern lecture given before a podium complete with confusing mathematics; Professor Tyson’s lectures have the feel of an informed conversation that manages to be both thorough and easy to grasp. With each of the inexplicable mysteries he lays bare for you; Professor Tyson ·introduces you to the history behind it; ·lays out the science that has helped us grasp it; ·explains what researchers have discovered to date; and ·reveals what we have yet to discover. And while the topics explore subjects in everything from quantum mechanics to cosmology to string theory; you’ll never feel overwhelmed by what you’re learning. In fact; you’re more likely to find yourself intrigued by just how much we know—and curious about what the near future will possibly reveal. Explore Fascinating Territory So what territory will you chart in this course? Here are some of the inexplicable ideas you’ll investigate in these lectures. ·Neutrinos: Discovered in 1956; these fast-moving; ghostlike particles are made in abundance in the sun’s core. They hardly interact with matter; it takes a light-year’s worth of lead (5.8 trillion miles) to stop a neutrino. Not only that; but 65 billion neutrinos pass through every centimeter of your body that’s facing the sun every second of every day. ·String theory: This astounding theory offers the hope of unifying all the particles and forces of physics. In the past several decades since the dawn of string theory; it’s been imagined that all the fundamental particles we see and measure are just the manifestation in our dimension of strings vibrating in higher dimensions and at different frequencies. ·Quantum foam: This idea posits that when the fabric of space and time is so tightly curved on itself; space-time is less a smooth curve and more like the froth on a latte. In this state of matter and energy; quantum fluctuations can spawn entire universes; each with slightly different laws of physics within them! In addition; you’ll also ·get a peek at what it would be like to travel through a black hole; ·ponder the possibility that life on Earth originated in debris from Mars; ·probe the supposed existence of multiple universes; and ·even imagine the possible end of the universe itself. A One-on-One Chat with a Renowned Science Educator Professor Tyson is renowned throughout the scientific community and the media for his vast knowledge; his penetrating insights; and his amazing ability to make even the most intimidating areas of science accessible; engaging; and—most of all—enjoyable. He brings the same inviting tone and sharp intellect to The Inexplicable Universe as he does to his range of media appearances on popular television programs; including The Daily Show with Jon Stewart; The Tonight Show with Jay Leno; and Real Time with Bill Maher. Professor Tyson’s lectures also feature expertly crafted animations; explanatory graphics; and other instructive visual elements designed to better explain to you some of the grand; intricate ideas being discussed. With The Inexplicable Universe; you’ll feel as if you’re participating in an exclusive chance to sit one-on-one with this renowned science educator and have a provocative; intriguing; and illuminating conversation. No other learning experience—including the most detailed science textbook—can bring you this close to interacting with an expert about the mysteries of the universe around you.

If you are someone who is suffering from depression or anxiety - whatever it may be; you will likely find this incredibly helpful. If you feel your fine; you ll still find this interesting and hopefully worthwhile. Better yet; not only for you; but for others you may know. All in all; I find the message here; uniquely; and heavily related to the messages to many of the figures I admire. There is much that can be said; but it is for you to experience and come up with a conclusion. I m sure it will be worth your while. Honestly; I found this message to be a fantastic and important gift. I m glad it s here free. - Brian 5-Star: Great program to make you think Its a great program that makes you think and see what it is that is really holding you back. No the question is what are you going to do about it after you ve completed the course. - Mirko 1-Star: rubbish this guy sounds like a total looney freak with an IQ level of a biscuite... you sure you should be teaching about genius? couldnt handle listening to more than half of the first lecture. - Pouya Interesting huh? So what s in the course? And why does it divide opinion so much? Tom Cassidy asks Richard Wilkins; the founder of the UK s Ministry of Inspiration ; to sum up his thoughts on  Being a Genius v. Accessing Genius . Richard explains his system that allows ordinary people to access the genius that is available to us all. It explains what it really means to  be  a genius; and why most people who are thought of as geniuses end up being somewhat disappointing as we find out more about them. It also enables us to deal with all the  yeah but...  beliefs that our own internal programmings throw up at us; and it allows us to be comfortable doing great things; without having to then live with the epithet  genius . In our experience of delivering this message to people; we ve found that a lot of people won t like the simplicity of the message; they won t dare to believe that they have the power to access genius themselves and they will resent the ease with which its methods appear to work. You see; if it really IS this simple then it takes away people s excuses for not doing it. And people might not like that very much. Anyway; Take this free “Access Your Genius” course; see what all the fuss is about and learn how to become a genius yourself. the world is waiting...,Appropriate for all,?

Price: $12. Duration: 59 mins.  Click to learn more and find similar courses.,How to Find College/University Online Teaching Jobs; Udemy; online Education courses,N/A,Online Course - How to Find College/University Online Teaching Jobs,Udemy,$12,59 mins,Yes,Brian McCabe; MA; MAS,Over the past decade; community colleges; major public universities; and private universities around the country have embraced and operationalized robust online and distance education programs; to meet the needs of the twenty-first century student. This is the largest growth area; within higher education; and all signs indicate that this trend will continue. However; finding online teaching jobs can be a little tricky and confusing. Relying on traditional job-seeking methods can make one miss the ideal online teaching opportunity; because not all higher education institutions recruit in the same way. The objective of this course; then; is to provide you with a comprehensive strategy and tools to effectively hunt for both academic and vocational online teaching jobs; at the college level. The course will include links to both mainstream and underutilized websites; current articles about legislation designed to promote and fund online education; and how to find jobs with out-of-state institutions. This course is concise and to the point. Each lecture is between five and ten minutes; allowing subscriber the flexibility to either finish quickly or to take their time. The structure of this course will consist of an informative introduction; three main sections; and a conclusion that will discuss how to maintain online employment in other; related ways. I will introduce the various types of online jobs; similarities and differences between types of institutions (public community college; public university; private university; online  mostly  programs). Then the class will explore how to best prepare yourself for job hunting online teaching jobs; at the college level; while discussing when colleges tend to hire faculty. The next section will explore the various strategies and tools to finding an online teaching job within your field (academic; vocational). Next; we will review the various learning software (Learning Management Systems) employed by institutions (Blackboard; Angel; Moodle; eCollege; etc.) and how to leverage them to effectively teach online. Finally; the course will cover how to maintain online employment into the future. This course is for anyone with Bachelor s degree and vocational trade or a Master s or terminal degree in an academic field who wishes to teach online. Online teaching allows many people with the experience or education to better balance responsibilities at home; while earning money as an educator. About me: I am a firm believer in online education; because I have been both a online learner and an online instructor. Having returned to school in my thirties; I appreciated the flexibility of a distance education program and learned that they can be wonderful vehicles for achieving educational goals. After I completed grad school; I was hired to design and teach an online geography course; for the University of New Mexico. This course was so successful; I was nominated for the  2009-2010 Outstanding Online Instructor of the Year Award.  I taught this course from my home in California. At the same time; I found a great position with Hutchinson Community College; in Kansas. In total; I taught about twenty classes for them; over four years. To this day; I have never set foot in Kansas. In California; I started teaching online for California State University; along with live courses. The benefit of teaching this way could hardly be measured. I was able to teach from home (remotely); which gave me both valuable teaching experience and the opportunity to better balance my responsibilities at home. So many of my friends and colleagues have and continue to ask me how I find these jobs around the country. In this class; I will teach you!,Appropriate for all,?

Knowing how to make the most effective use of that mail list is where most people struggle. Not anymore.

Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistent needs and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itself in many ways; from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairy godmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting Dracula. From a practical viewpoint; of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes; science fiction; from Frankenstein to Avatar; is the most important in our modern world because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profound ways in which science and technology; those key products of the human mind; shape not only our world but our very hopes and fears.

Fruit and nut trees comprise the upper canopy of the forest while below are berry shrubs; edible perennials; herbs; root crops and annuals. Companion plants are included to attract beneficial insects; build the soil; and provide mulch.  Together they create a sustainable forest garden ecosystem able to produce high yields of food with less maintenance. In this course Michael Pilarski; permaculture and wildcrafting expert; teaches you how to turn your back yard into a food forest.  Filmed on site in Michael s back yard; this is not a classroom-based course.  Michael teaches the basics of food forest planting while planting his own medicinal food forest on 1/8 of an acre.  Does an 1/8 of an acre sound big to you?  Don t worry!  In this course Michael talks about how to scale what you re learning to your own back yard.  Forest gardening is an ancient art and science that can teach you sustainable methods for growing your food and medicine.  As Masanobu Fukuoka once said;  The ultimate goal of farming is not the growing of crops; but the cultivation and perfection of human beings.   Forest gardening allows you to experience ecology first hand.  It provides you with a rare opportunity to live with nature and learn how to exist a little more sustainably. ,Appropriate for all,?

Infectious diseases have the potential to travel quickly and spread widely across countries (e.g. due to increased international travel). The determinants of health (such as the food system) are across country borders; leading to a growing burden in non-communicable diseases in both developed and developing countries. Issues in traditionally non health sectors such as climate change or trade can have dramatic and worldwide effects on health and health systems. These short examples illustrate what Global Health is about:  issues that not only cross national boundaries but also disciplinary territories. In our interdependent world; more and more health issues cannot be addressed by a country nor by a sector alone and require collaboration; coordination and integration. The course will draw from academic personnel working across disciplines and the wider community in international Geneva (e.g. international organisations; NGOs). It will utilise an ecological or  systems  perspective; along with a social determinants and human rights approach to health.,Appropriate for all,?

Cramer,Statistical Molecular Thermodynamics is a course in physical chemistry that relates the microscopic properties of molecules to the macroscopic behavior of chemical systems. Quantized molecular energy levels and their use in the construction of molecular and ensemble partition functions is described. Thermodynamic state functions; their dependence on the partition function; and their relationships with one another (as dictated by the three Laws of Thermodynamics) are all examined in detail. Analysis and demonstration takes place primarily in the context of ideal and real gases. This eight-week course covers slightly more than half of a typical semester-long course in chemical thermodynamics. Typical topics to be addressed subsequently would be phase equilibria; liquids; solutions of non-electrolytes and electrolytes; and chemical reaction equilibria. Students who successfully complete the course will be able to predict how changes in molecular properties will influence the macroscopic behavior of those substances; they will understand the relationships between energy; heat; and work; and be able to predict how much work can be extracted from a given chemical process under various sets of conditions; they will understand the role of entropy in physical and chemical processes; and they will be able to engineer conditions to make chemical reactions spontaneously favorable (or not). Students will also become adept with differential calculus as a tool to derive and manipulate relationships between connected thermodynamic variables and state functions.,Appropriate for all,?

At the same time; we have always known that social factors play a very strong role in promoting mental health and can make big differences in who gets mentally ill; who gets treated for mental illness; and how people can achieve good quality of life after a mental health diagnosis. This course is an opportunity to explore how social practices and ideas contribute to the ways in which society; families and individuals are affected by mental health and mental illness. We will look at issues like why some people think mental illness is a myth; how people think about mental health and illness in different cultures; who gets mentally ill and why; how families are affected by mental illness and what interventions are available to treat mental illness and promote mental health.,Appropriate for all,?

Duration: 6 weeks.  Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Computational Molecular Evolution; Coursera; online Math and Science courses,N/A,Online Course - Computational Molecular Evolution,Coursera,Free,6 weeks,Yes,Anders Gorm Pedersen,This course is about molecular evolution - the evolution of DNA; RNA; and protein molecules. The focus is on computational methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from sequence data; and the course will give an introduction to the fundamental theory and algorithms; while also giving the student hands-on experience with some widely used software tools. Since evolutionary theory is the conceptual foundation of biology (in the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky:  Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution ); what you learn on this course will be relevant for any project you will ever do inside the life sciences. A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem.  A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches); and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution; and in science more generally. A mathematical (statistical) model of a biological system can be considered to be a stringently phrased hypothesis about that system; and this way of thinking about models will often be helpful. In addition to model-based methods; you will also learn about other approaches; such as those based on parsimony and genetic distance (e.g.; neighbor joining).  Often; the evolutionary tree is the result we are interested in - knowing how a set of sequences (or organisms) are related can provide us with important information about the biological problem we are  investigating. For instance; knowing which organisms are most closely related to a newly identified; uncharacterized; pathogenic bacterium will allow you to infer many aspects of its lifestyle; thereby giving you important clues about how to fight it. In other cases; however; inferring the structure of the tree is not the goal: for instance; our main focus may instead be the detection of positions in a protein undergoing positive selection (indicating adaptation) or negative selection (indicating conserved functional importance). However; even in these cases; the underlying phylogenetic tree will be an important part of our hypothesis about (model of) how the proteins have been evolving; and will help in getting the correct answer.  Although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding; this course has been designed to be accessible also for students with limited computational background (e.g.; students of biology). Topics covered: Brief introduction to evolutionary theory and population genetics. Mechanisms of molecular evolution. Models of substitution. Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees using parsimony; distance based methods; maximum likelihood; and Bayesian techniques. Advanced models of nucleotide substitution (gamma-distributed mutation rates; codon models and analysis of selective pressure). Statistical analysis of biological hypotheses (likelihood ratio tests; Akaike Information Criterion; Bayesian statistics).,Appropriate for all,?

Esta capacidad además; empieza a desaparecer a partir de los 6 años; por lo que es vital aprovechar este periodo de tiempo para exponer a nuestros hijos a un segundo idioma. La exposición debería ser lo más natural posible. Así como uno aprende su lengua materna también puede aprender un segundo idioma. El idioma materno se adquiere escuchando y repitiendo lo que escuchamos. Para aprender un segundo idioma; necesitamos repetir el proceso de escuchar para poder repetir lo que oímos. La escucha o lo que yo llamo la exposición a los impactos auditivos del idioma (Teoría de los Impactos) debe ser lo más intensiva posible y en el caso de un bebé esto sólo se puede conseguir si creamos un entorno bilingüe en el hogar. Para crear un entorno bilingüe o aumentar las horas de exposición al segundo idioma hay varias cosas que pueden hacer los padres: Poner la tele en inglés. Comprar juguetes que hablan en inglés. Comprar cuentos con CD s de audio en inglés. Asistir a actividades lúdicas que se desarrollen en inglés. Ir al teatro en inglés. Viajar a un país de habla inglesa. Tener una aupair inglesa en casa. Asistir a una guardería inglesa. ... Pero sin duda lo más importante y lo más valioso es si los padres también hablan en inglés a lo largo del día. Una persona que domina el inglés lo tendrá más o menos fácil pero también es posible para una persona cuyo nivel de inglés es básico. Poco a poco; se pueden ir aprendiendo frases usuales que se utilizan a lo largo del día en las rutinas que compartimos con nuestros bebés. Por ejemplo; en las comidas; en la hora de acostarse; el baño; etc. El curso Inglés en 9 Meses ofrece precisamente esto; frases y vocabulario que los papás podrán usar con sus bebés/hijos todos los días. De esta manera; no sólo se apoya el desarrollo de un futuro bilingüismo si no que el padre o madre en cuestión mejora su propio nivel de inglés. Este curso es una muestra gratuita del curso completo. Cómo funciona Abre una lección por día. Escucha y repite lo que escuchas. Trata de no leer ya que ahí empiezan los problemas de pronunciación. Imita el sonido. Memoriza las frases de la lección diaria y busca situaciones para practicarlas. Si tienes un smartphone o tablet; descarga la app de Udemy. Este curso equivale a la primera parte de 9 cursos.

I teach The Art of Less Doing; a framework for productivity I developed to help people optimize; automate; and outsource everything in their lives and be more effective. I m constantly writing about new ways to save you time and get more done at my Less Doing blog.  Having a clean inbox is an essential basis for being more productive which is why I created this course. Achieving an empty inbox is not that hard when you have the right methods and tools. This course begins with my philosophy and methodology for dealing with email. It takes you through the steps of getting started with Gmail and setting it up the way I reccomend. The second part of the course gives details on each of the amazing add ons or related services that I beleive are essential to maximize productivity. I chose to utilize videos produced by the creators of these products because they explain them better than I ever could.  IFTTT is a free service that allows you to create automations between popular web services so you can  set it and forget it  and get back to the work you need to do. Virtual Assistants bring the whole process full circle by allowing you to outsource all of the tasks you don t want to do and haven t been able to automate. The value I hope you get from this course is my step-by-step; cohesive assembly of tools created by the tech community framed with my original content and methods for getting the most out of email.

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Beyond Silicon Valley: Growing Entrepreneurship in Transitioning Economies; Coursera; online Business courses,N/A,Online Course - Beyond Silicon Valley: Growing Entrepreneurship in Transitioning Economies,Coursera,Free,6 weeks,Yes,N/A,The path for entrepreneurs to grow their companies outside of well-developed entrepreneurial ecosystems like Silicon Valley is challenging. Most markets around the world do not look like Silicon Valley; and they never will. But there are other models to support new businesses. In transitioning markets (where entrepreneurs do not have much access to private sector financing); government officials; donors; and business leaders are experimenting with creative approaches to support the growth of entrepreneurs. Northeast Ohio; whose largest city is Cleveland; is one such community. During our time together in this course; we will be exploring some of these innovative approaches. A massive intervention of government and donor resources in Northeast Ohio has been in place for over ten years. In that time; Northeast Ohio has experienced success (including job creation and follow-on funding) with alternative methods of financing startups; but it has not been easy. Yes; some progress has been made; but whether or not they ve hit on ultimate success has yet to be determined. A dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem takes many years; even decades; to develop. Government officials and donors typically are looking for shorter term success with their support programs which makes long-term support for entrepreneurship challenging. During this course; we will hear from entrepreneurs who have launched products and services ranging from medical devices to LED lights to whiskey. You will learn how these entrepreneurs engaged with resources made available to them through a variety of programs and intermediary organizations. We have chosen to talk with many business people that are still in the process of developing their companies and whose ultimate success or failure is still to be determined. One of our goals is to learn from you how different communities around the world are approaching implementing strategies and methods to support businesses. Taking what we ve learned from our examples in class; I will ask you to reflect on how to best grow entrepreneurship where you live. I am excited to use this global platform to create a dialogue where information flows in multiple directions. Most MOOCs rebroadcast professors’ lectures; but this course will be different. Don’t expect to see me standing in front of the camera; talking and lecturing every week. Instead; the lectures will be relatively short in length (8-10 minutes) and will have more of the feel of an engaging documentary than a static classroom setting. We will also be providing you with opportunities for live engagement with the featured entrepreneurs and thought leaders through a number of interactive sessions during the course.,Appropriate for all,?

Many times some of what needs to be tested and how it needs to be tested gets lost in the translation. Wouldn t it be easier if the business person or QA person could just create the test cases themselves and still have them automated? FitNesse is a great testing framework that allows you to do just that. Using FitNesse; a developer creates test fixtures that allow non-technical people to write tests just by modifying a Wiki page. In this course I ll walk you through the steps to get set up and running with FitNesse. I ll show you how to use the older Fit style of creating test and the newer Slim style and we ll cover both Java and .NET; since FitNesse can work with either platform.

In addition to explicit content standards (which describe what students will know); the CCSSM present a broad range of practice standards that describe ways that successful students in math demonstrate proficiency. What do students and teachers need to know to take on these standards? What does it mean; for example; for students to persevere through new and challenging problems; and/or critique the reasoning of other students; and how can their teachers best support them? In the words of one math teacher; “it’s not the students’ job to figure out what is in our heads; it’s the teacher’s job to figure out what is in theirs.” Such an approach requires far more focus on formative assessment and deliberate strategies for teachers to pre-assess students’ assets; needs; and misconceptions – then move them forward while continually re-assessing.,Appropriate for all,?

Price: Free Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Social Entrepreneurship; Coursera; online Business courses,N/A,Online Course - Social Entrepreneurship,Coursera,Free,N/A,Yes,N/A,The domain of social change is no longer reserved for students of political sciences and development studies. Increasingly business students are recognized as possessing important skills that can drive social change. This new discipline is often referred to as Social Entrepreneurship (S-ENT). S-ENT describes the discovery and sustainable exploitation of opportunities to create public goods. This is usually done through the generation of disequilibria in market and non-market environments. The S-ENT process can in some cases lead to the creation of social enterprises. These social ventures are hybrid organizations exhibiting characteristics of both the for-profit and not-for-profit sector. Individuals engaging in S-ENT are usually referred to as social entrepreneurs; a term that describes resourceful individuals working to create social innovation. They do not only have to identify (or create) opportunities for social change (that so far have been unexploited); they must also muster the resources necessary to turn these opportunities into reality.  A typical example is Prof. Muhammad Yunus; founder of the Grameen Bank (Bangladesh) and recipient of the Nobel Peace prize in recognition of his contribution to poverty alleviation through the invention and popularization of Microfinance. Other examples include fair trade or car-sharing. Today many foundations aim to identify and promote social entrepreneurs. Two prominent examples are Ashoka and the Skoll Foundation. So called venture philanthropists adopt methods from the domain of venture capital; for example; encouraging social entrepreneurs to provide detailed business plans and to measure and report systematically on their social performance. Social Return on Investment (S-ROI) analysis is an example; of an emerging tool aiming to describe the social impact of S-ENT in dollar terms; relative to the philanthropic investment made.,Appropriate for all,?

Our overarching goal is to support participants in developing the knowledge and skills needed to take up student thinking in ways that enable all students to learn challenging subject matter – a practice we call “leveraging student thinking”. Course content will focus primarily on middle grades classrooms in various disciplines; but the practice of leveraging student thinking is applicable to all subject areas and grade levels. Participants will explore the design of curricular tasks; the analysis of patterns of talk; and the use of representational tools to: elicit student thinking; attend to significant features of that thinking; interpret students’ ideas within a developmental framework; and bridge from students’ current understandings to more sophisticated understandings. These ideas will be introduced through guided engagement with video cases. Analysis of the video cases will highlight the elements involved in leveraging student thinking; and also will illustrate the epistemic; academic; developmental and managerial “pressure points” that challenge teachers’ ability to capitalize on student thinking in constructive ways. Throughout the course; participants will further explore and test out these ideas in their own classrooms; be they formal or informal. (A Sunday school class; a scout troop; a homeschool opportunity; or a traditional classroom environment would all be appropriate; but some kind of teaching practice is necessary to benefit from the course.)  The goal is to work on the work of teaching while teaching. In addition; critical reflection with a group of partners is an important component of this course.  At key points; participants will be asked to document their work to share with peers for feedback. Therefore; we strongly encourage teachers to plan to work through this course in teams (of two to four people) to facilitate mutual observation; analysis and discussion. Teachers who do not have a team at the beginning of the course will be able to create a team through online forums at the beginning of the course and can exchange their teaching examples through video or narrative descriptions.,Appropriate for all,?

Its a human institution trying to start something new under extreme conditions of uncertainty; says author Eric Ries. Its not that some founders have better ideas than others; and this is what dictates success. What differentiates a successfully launched enterprise is one who can unearth the best ideas under duress - those who can find &quot;the pivot&quot;- the point of reinvention when they realize that their original ideas need retooling.

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Food is Your Best Medicine; Udemy; online Health and Fitness courses,N/A,Online Course - Food is Your Best Medicine,Udemy,$30,2 hours,Yes,Veronica Waks M.D.; N.D.,Have you ever worried about; or been diagnosed with; high blood pressure; diabetes or cancer? Have you tried to lose weight; but failed? A healthy diet filled with fruits and vegetables is an excellent weapon for preventing and battling cancer; heart disease and obesity. It is a proven fact: cancer cells have 20 times more receptors for sugar then normal cells. If your diet is full of sugar; cancer will be more likely to get triggered and will grow faster. Unfortunately we have been conditioned to rely too heavily on powerful synthetic medicines to cure these ailments. Few think about changing their diets to combat them. But throughout the history of medicine doctors never made this artificial separation between food and medicine. Treating elevated blood pressure; heart disease; cancer and diabetes with synthetic chemical medications is a recent; and largely unsuccessful; trend. You simply cannot prevent disease or restore health by taking pills. In this course I teach you how to rethink every dietary choice and its impact on your health. You need this foundational knowledge to evaluate nutritional and medical claims and to design – and stick to – the food plan that is best for you. The course explains the key role of each nutritional building block for healthy cells. It consists of 10 short lectures; each about 10 to 15 minutes long. The first lecture is on proteins. Amino acids are building blocks for proteins. You break down the proteins in your foods into individual amino acids in your digestive tract. These amino acids are then absorbed into your blood stream and sent to all of your cells. The cells then construct from these amino acids the exact proteins they need for cell health. The second lecture is about fats. Your body requires fat to function; but there are good and bad dietary fats and you will learn to select the best ones for your health. Lecture three is about “simple” and “complex” carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are the main source of energy. The body and brain need a steady dose of sugars; but simple carbs can wreak havoc with your health. In this lecture you will learn about the best foods to supply the carbs you need. Your body needs vitamins and minerals to get all your other nutrients to where they can do their jobs in your cells. In lecture four you will learn about the best fruits and vegetables you can select as sources of vitamins; minerals; fibers and sugar. Every few months a new diet makes a big splash in the media; promising instant health and weight reduction. Most of these diets are hazardous to your health; and diets cannot provide long-term weight reduction. In lecture five you will learn about the pros and cons of today’s most popular diets; and how you can design your own eating plan to maintain optimum health and body weight. Lecture six is about your “healthy plate”. It explains exactly what you should and should not put on your plate – and the right portion sizes - to make sure that you maximize your nutrients consumption to keep your body healthy and to restore health when struck with cancer; heart disease and other ailments. Lectures 7; 8 and 9 are about structure and function of the digestive tract and it importance in overall health of your body and its cells. You will learn how a malfunctioning digestive tract will prevent absorption of nutrients; starve your cells; lead to disease; and prevent recovery. Finally; in lecture 10 you will learn what happens to all the nutrients in your food once they get absorbed from the digestive tract into your blood stream. The emphasis will be on how you use these nutrients to build; protect; restore and repair your cellular structures to heal yourself and keep yourself in optimum health. Some foods are not discussed in my lectures. For example: cookies; cakes; chips or French fries are not considered food; because they have so few nutrients and so much sugar that they can make you sick and keep you sick - you will be much better without them. Also; there are no canned foods on my “healthy plate”. Food from cans and jars has few vitamins; but is full of preservatives and coloring agents that may contribute to coronary disease; cancer. Long term health and vitality are out of questions if cookies; candy; ice cream and canned vegetables/fruit are part of your regular diet. I hope to see you in my course. Here’s to your health.,Appropriate for all,?

And it is actually much easier than you think; especially now that you can develop games completely using web technologies you probably are already familiar with. Modern browsers today that have support for HTML5 and fast JavaScript engines are more than capable of running complex games that would have been impossible years earlier. In this course; I’ll show you how to create a complete game using only HTML5 and JavaScript. We’ll start off by learning the basics of game development and the basics of how HTML5 and modern browser technologies support it. Then; we’ll dive right in and start implementing the basics of a game. We’ll start off by actually creating the start of a game completely from scratch; implementing everything ourselves. Once we’ve seen the basics of doing things from scratch; we’ll introduce a JavaScript game engine to help us out as we learn about Quintus and start building our first real complete game. From there on we’ll expand our game little by little as we add features like moving a player around and firing shots in the game. We’ll also learn how to create enemies in the game and give them some intelligence. So; if you are interested in game development or if you just want to see what is possible with HTML5; check out this course. You’ll be surprised how easily you can put together a real HTML5 game.,Intermediate,?

Many women have found prenatal yoga to be a great support through many of the changes that pregnancy brings.  This can be a very exciting time but also a little overwhelming as you are figuring out how to take care of yourself and your growing baby at the same time. Whether this is your first or your fourth baby; self-care is an essential part of a healthy pregnancy! I have created this prenatal yoga class so you can receive all the benefits of yoga during your pregnancy. What are the benefits of prenatal yoga? • Builds strength and flexibility (to do the work of mothering) • Promotes proper posture; body awareness and healthy alignment • Reduces stress and promotes relaxation (good for mother and baby) • Increases energy (growing a person is exhausting) • Aids with focus (helps combat “fetal brain drain”) • Promotes healthy circulation and reduces swelling • Reduces or eliminates common pregnancy discomforts Prenatal yoga can help prepare body and mind for childbirth. The prenatal yoga postures are specially designed to not only strengthen your body but to build flexibility and openness – it is just as important to create suppleness so you can open when the time comes to birth your baby. Birthing a baby requires both great effort and the ability to totally let go. We cultivate a balance of effort and surrender on the yoga mat so we can take it into labor and birth. Last but not least… Prenatal yoga promotes baby awareness! In the practice of yoga; you have the opportunity to acknowledge the presence of your baby; not as a package that will arrive at some future date or that is “delivered” to you; but as a being that is here now. Yoga allows space to sit in the present moment; with yourself as well as with your baby. This program can be done in its entirety or you can do one or more of the individual lectures. Enjoy the music of Sam Jackson s crystal bowls; www.vibrantstillness.com  and Eric Fraser s lullabys ragabyebaby.com . Special note: It is very important for you to listen to your body. Take rest if needed. Come out of any posture that causes strain or excessive discomfort. Please exercise caution in the practice. If you experience dizziness; shortness of breath; chest pain; abdominal pain; uterine contractions; vaginal bleeding or fluid leakage from your vagina or have history high blood pressure or any other serious medical condition; consult your midwife or doctor. Yoga may not be appropriate for some women in the first trimester. If you have a history of miscarriage or pregnancy loss please consult with your care provider before taking this course. Prenatal Yoga is suitable for most healthy pregnant women.  ,Appropriate for all,?

As discussed earlier; human beings fell from the top of the growth stage and have been held under Satan s dominion ever since. To restore human beings; God works to cut off Satan s influence. Yet; as was explained in Christology; we must have the original sin removed before we can sever Satan s bonds and be restored to the state before the Fall. This is possible only when we are born anew through the Messiah; the True Parent. To explain further: we first need to go through a course to separate Satan from ourselves. We do this in order to restore ourselves in form to the spiritual level which Adam and Eve had reached before the Fall-the top of the growth stage. On this foundation; we are to receive the Messiah and be reborn; and thereby be fully restored to the original state of human beings before the Fall. Finally; by following the Messiah; we should continue our growth to maturity where we can fulfill the purpose of creation. Since the providence of restoration is God s work of re-creation; which has as its goal the fulfillment of the purpose of creation; God works this providence in accordance with His Principle. In the course of the providence of restoration; this principle is called the Principle of Restoration. Let us study how the providence of restoration is to be accomplished with the remainder of this course.,Appropriate for all,?
