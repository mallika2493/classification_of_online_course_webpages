You have a DSLR Camera or a fancy Point-and-shoot; but have not been using it to it s full potential. You know that the scary  manual mode  holds a whole new level of customization which would result in better quality photos but have resisted. Terms like Shutter Speed and Aperture sound confusing and you don t know where to start. If that sounds familiar; I want to assure you that by the end of my FREE course you will understand what those settings do and be on your way to controlling your camera rather than your camera controlling you. You made an investment in a decent camera and it s time to start using it s features In this course you will learn the basics of DSLR Photography and how to shoot in manual mode. My goal is to give you the tools so you can train your brain to think like a Photographer. You will also know how to control your camera instead of leaving it up to Auto Mode to try and to it s best. How Long Is This Course? So far; the course is just over 4 hours in length. You can watch it in chunks or all at once. It is best to watch it with camera in hand so you can pause and follow along with your camera. All DSLR Cameras are different so your settings may look different than mine. What Should I Expect? You should expect to be able to shoot photos with confidence in pretty much all situations. Whether you are taking pictures of your kids for the memories or are considering Photography as a profession; this is everything I had to teach myself in order to understand my camera. Who are you Jerad Hill? I am a Wedding Photographer with over 6 years of professional experience. I have shot over 200 weddings; 120 engagement sessions; 150 portrait sessions and 1000 s of photos of my own kids. For fun I have shot live concerts and music videos. I am also a Wedding Videographer and do a lot with video. Expect a course on DSLR Video soon. Thanks for checking out my course.

Together; they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses; but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses. Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take; we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said; they are not  computation appreciation  courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will. Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python covers the notion of computation; the Python programming language; some simple algorithms; testing and debugging; and informal introduction to algorithmic complexity; and some simple algorithms and data structures. Recommended textbook. The recommended textbook for this course is: Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python; Revised and Expanded edition; by John Guttag (MIT Press; 2013).

Is it even hard to draw a cartoon?   You see other artists’ work and think; why can’t I draw my figures like that? I used to feel the same way until I discovered the secrets of figure drawing; and I’m going to share them with you.   Tim thought he would never be a concept artist because his figure drawings weren’t good enough; but then he found my 10 hour course; and guess what? He’s now a concept artist.   You too can draw the human figure like a master artist.   “I want to help Neil because he helped me. I owe my job to him. His teaching techniques and teaching style made everything finally click. I just got it! I started drawing figures that looked good. What a great feeling. Even if I never landed my dream career; just the feeling of drawing great figures was worth every penny Neil charges. I can’t believe he offers so much for so little.” – Tim.   Don’t give up on yourself. You can draw people; and you won’t believe how little it will cost you.   You want to draw for a living; or paint for a living; but the human figure is holding you back; but it doesn’t have to anymore. After you go through 10 hours of video containing my step-by-step drawing lessons and my best-kept secrets; you’ll draw the human figure like never before! Guaranteed. I mean that.   I can guarantee it because I’ve seen it work again and again for my students.   You should see Kim’s before and after; but I don’t know how to post that here.   It worked for me. You should see how my figures used to look. I almost gave up!   Once the secrets of drawing the human figure clicked; I made quick leaps. Would you believe that before and after was only 30 days after I figured the secrets of figure drawing out? Yes. It’s true. It only takes some two weeks. I want to repeat that because it’s so awesome.   You can learn how to draw the human figure in two weeks!   What? Crazy; right? My students are evidence. I am evidence. I’ve seen it work for me and others.   You just have to watch the videos and do the exercises. That’s it.   You can have that dream job; drawing or painting.   You can make money with your art.   You can; you can; you can.   But you’ve tried art courses? You read some figure drawing books? You even paid for personal art lessons?   Why will my course be any different?   Because it is different. Why don’t figure drawing books tell you how important it is to master the stick figure before you even start drawing mannequins? Because not every artist is a great teacher. Most master artists either don’t know or don’t remember what it takes to get to that level.   They don’t know how to break down the step-by-step learning process that is necessary for most people to draw the human figure like a pro. That is what this course does for you. It turns you into a figure drawing professional.   I guarantee you will finally be happy with your figure drawings once you complete Master the Human Figure that I will give your money back if you aren’t. Of the 1;297 people that have bought the course so far; not one of them has complained. Not one.   But you won’t ever be able to draw the human figure?   If you can master the basic stick figure; you can draw the human figure.   It’s true.   Students have told me I should charge $500 for this 10 hour course Master the Human Figure. I don’t. I’m not even charging the normal $69 dollars.   What am I charging then? You are probably ready to punch me.   But why? Why would I do that?   Because; I have no overhead; no electric bill to pay; no office rent; no CD’s to produce; etc. I offer you the 10 hours as instant streaming video; with fast servers. You can even download them.   “I had spent a lot of money previously on books and classes however what i have learned from both your Mastering the Human Figure and the Mastering the Human Head is incredible. What i enjoy most of your courses is that you break down the *Formulas*; and i really enjoy the fact that you are always stressinsg the importance of practice; practice; practice. I went from being frustrated and stuck to excited and motiviated. And thank you for making it soo affordable; THANK YOU...”–Orlando Piedrahita; CA   Why should I over charge you? It only cost like $100 to produce a new; flat-screen TV; and they sell them for $300 and up. I’m not going to do that to you. My conscience won’t allow it.   Why do my students believe I should charge $500?   Because you get 10 hours of video lessons. You watch over my shoulder as I draw and teach you as if you were right there with me. You are getting 10 hours of personal teaching.   Just look at all the lessons.   In the fast-paced world of professional concept art; you must learn to draw quickly. This means you need to be able to draw the human figure from your mind; especially if you want to be a comic artist. That’s exactly what these lessons will do for you. Without any reference; You will draw people in complex poses.   The lessons take you from stick man to fully muscled figures.

Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning; not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking; to check your understanding; for fun; etc... But really; they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence; so try not to let them stress you out. What should I do while I’m watching the videos? Learn actively!

What’s so great about Python? Python is powerful. The Python language is expressive and productive; it comes with a great standard library; and it’s the center of a huge universe of wonderful third-party libraries. With Python you can build everything from simple scripts to complex applications; you can do it quickly; and you can do it with fewer lines of code than you might think possible. But for many people those reasons take back-seat to something more important: Python is fun! Python’s readable style; quick edit-and-run development cycle; and “batteries included” philosophy mean that you can sit down and enjoy writing code rather than fighting compilers and thorny syntax. As your experiments become prototypes and your prototypes become products; Python makes the experience of writing software not just easier but truly enjoyable.

War has become virtually unthinkable in the EU. When the first steps towards supranational cooperation - primarily targeted at preventing the rearmament of Germany - were made in the aftermath of World War Two; the Founding Fathers of the European integration construct could never have imagined this outcome in their wildest dreams. Over the years; the supranational cooperation would widen - from the original European Communities consisting of 6 Member States to the current Union of 27 Members – and deepen – from the originally almost purely economically inspired Communities to the current Union with a say in almost all areas of national competence. At the same time; problems with the Euro have plunged the EU in one of the biggest crises since its inception. This challenges lawmakers to tackle difficult questions about the continued existence of the Euro and the future direction of the European integration project. This course will give the students an insight into the law of the EU; a vast and fascinating area of law which forms an integral part of the legal systems of its 27 Member States. The course is divided into three parts. In the first part; we will pay attention to the creation and the development of the EU; its institutional structure and functioning; and the specific nature and sources of EU law. In the second part; we will examine how EU law impacts on the lives of EU citizens as well as on companies that are established or provide services in the EU. In the final part; we will tackle Europe’s common currency crisis; investigating causes; effects and possible routes out of this existential crisis of the Union. If you are a student; lawyer; entrepreneur or simply interested in the EU; its development and legal system; this course will provide you with the foundations. The course is of interest to people both inside and outside the European Union: EU citizens may learn how to benefit from the rights contained in EU life; people from other parts of the world may learn from the EU’s specific set-up; its functioning and the legal solutions being applied in the European context.,Appropriate for all,?

Attending explicitly to disciplinary context; you will learn to read critically; write effective arguments; understand the writing process; and craft powerful prose that meets readers’ expectations. You will gain writing expertise by exploring questions about expertise itself: What factors impact expert achievement? What does it take to succeed? Who determines success? Since personal investment yields better writing; you can select an area of expertise meaningful to you (a hobby; trade; profession; discipline; etc.) for your major writing projects; which will be drafted and revised in sequenced stages: a critical review to an argument about expertise (600-800 words); an explication of a visual image (600-800 words); a case study of an expert (1000-1250 words) and an Op-Ed (500-750 words). Your writing will be central to the course as we create a seminar/workshop structure with peer response and selected instructor feedback.  Two overarching assumptions about academic writing will shape our work:  1) it is transferable; 2) it is learnable. Being an effective academic writer involves asking meaningful questions and engaging in complex dialogue with texts and ideas. These skills are useful across virtually all academic disciplines and they provide a valuable means for making sense of non-academic experiences as well. Perhaps even more important; though; is that learning how to write effectively does not require inspiration or genius; but hard work; reflection; and feedback. This means that; with practice; dedication; and working with others; you can be an effective academic writer and contribute your ideas to important; ongoing conversations. Let s start now.

The goal of descriptive statistics is to summarize and present numerical information in a manner that is illuminating and useful. The course will cover graphical as well as numerical summaries of data; starting with a single variable and progressing to the relation between two variables. Methods will be illustrated with data from a variety of areas in the sciences and humanities. There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout Stat2.1x; the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations; the assumptions under which they are valid; and the correct interpretation of results.,Appropriate for all,?

Now Lean Analytics dives deeper into the measurement component of that cycle. The best-selling book is being translated into eight languages; and its authors—startup veterans Ben Yoskovitz and Alistair Croll—have travelled the world teaching founders how to use data to build a better startup faster. In June; 2013; Alistair and Ben presented an all-day workshop in conjunction with Geckoboard at London s Barbican centre; which we re now making available online. With energy; humour; and a disarming bluntness they ll take you through the concepts of their book: What makes a good metric; how to match the data you track to the stage of your growth; drawing lines in the sand; and changing the culture of organisations of all sizes. About the presenters In 2010; Alistair and Ben were two of the co-founders of Year One Labs; an early stage accelerator that provided funding and up to 1-year of hands-on mentorship to 5 startups. Year One Labs followed a Lean Startup program; making it the first accelerator to formalize such a structure. Three of five companies graduated from Year One Labs and went on to raise follow-on financing. A great deal of their experience and thought leadership around Lean Startup and analytics emerged during this time. Alistair has been an entrepreneur; author; and public speaker for nearly 20 years. He’s worked on a variety of topics; from web performance; to big data; to cloud computing; to startups; in that time. In 2001; he co-founded web performance startup Coradiant (acquired by BMC in 2011); and since that time has also launched Rednod; CloudOps; Bitcurrent; Year One Labs; the Bitnorth conference; the International Startup Festival and several other early-stage companies. Alistair is the chair of O’Reilly’s Strata conference; Cloud Connect; and Interop’s Enterprise Cloud Summit. This is his fourth book on analytics; technology; and entrepreneurship. Alistair lives in Montreal; Canada and tries to mitigate chronic ADD by writing about far too many things at Solve For Interesting. Ben is a serial entrepreneur with 15+ years experience in web businesses. He started his first company in 1996 while completing university. In 2007 he co-founded Standout Jobs; a B2B software company in the recruitment space. The company raised $1.8M from venture and angel investors. In 2010 after exiting Standout Jobs; Ben co-founded Year One Labs. Ben has been blogging since 2006. The “Instigator Blog” is recognized as one of the top blogs on startups and entrepreneurship. Ben is also an active mentor to numerous startups and other accelerator programs; including FounderFuel (a TechStars-like program in Montreal.) He regularly speaks at startup conferences and events; including the Michigan Lean Startup Conference; Internet Marketing Conference; etc. Ben is currently the VP of Product at GoInstant; a venture-backed startup developing co-browsing technology for shared web experiences.

To illustrate; I use a mouse (nothing fancy like a Wacom or Cintiq); and rarely view the actual vector points making up the illustration. Instead I teach simple techniques to mold shapes. This one hour session covers step-by-step how to illustrate a basic head; and this portion of the course is free. Session 2: The Body This two hour tutorial focuses on illustrating a clothed body. Initially we look at some simple clothing choices to avoid working with the finer points of illustrating the female form (i.e. a big dress). After that I will design a more realistic body in silouhette; to use as the basis for a fully shaded illustration. That piece is drawn over the course of an hour; in real time; using symbols for parts that could be animated later. Session 3: Hair Styles and Head Turns In this 90 minute session; we look at tips to illustrate hair and turn the head. The part on head turns should be particularly useful to any Flash or vector artist; since I demonstrate some interesting ways to start from a front view and methodically convert all the way over to a side view. Session 4: Expressions; hands; and feet. In this 97 minute session; we gather together various  components  of the body to use in our final session. To make drawing a full pose easier; we can create libraries of body parts and facial expressions to copy and paste into later projects. You are welcome to use my source files in your future projects as well. Session 5: Final pieces. In this three hour session; we draw three final poses; focusing primarily on clothing techniques and shading. Each pose is a separate one hour video.,Appropriate for all,?

Why use C# instead of C++; Java; ActionScript; or some other programming language you may have heard of? First; using C# lets us use the Microsoft XNA and open-source MonoGame frameworks; which help us quickly develop games for Windows; Android; iOS; Mac OS; and others. Second; the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers; and C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment. And finally; C# is a really good language for learning how to program. That learning how to program comment is important because this course doesn t assume you have any previous programming experience. Don t worry if you ve never written code before; we ll start at the very beginning and work our way up to building a small; complete game by the end of the course. Throughout the course you ll learn core programming concepts that apply to lots of programming languages; including C#; and you ll also learn how to apply those concepts when you develop games: drawing all the entities in the game world; updating the game world based on user input and simple physics; playing music and sound effects in your games; and so on.

Property and contract provide the institutional scaffolding that makes free exchange in markets possible; while the liability systems of tort and crime appear to mimic market exchange in areas of human activity where free exchange itself; for well-defined reasons; is not possible. This course seeks to expose this underlying economic logic through the close investigation of a series of paradigmatic problems and examples in light of some simple but very powerful economic ideas. The course assumes no prior background in economics or law; and begins with an introduction to the basic concepts of property; exchange; efficiency and externality. On this foundation; specific topics in the law; including property; tort and crime; eminent domain; intellectual property and criminal procedure; are considered. Each group of lectures will elaborate on a different concrete problem or example to suggest the range of legal issues and questions to which economic reasoning can be productively applied. The ideas and modes of analysis developed in the course are not difficult or mysterious; but the questions of interpretation and policy that they raise about a subject that affects everyone are challenging and provocative.,Appropriate for all,?

If you’re feeling generous; we would love to have you contribute your thoughts; questions; and answers to the course discussion forum. What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning; not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking; to check your understanding; for fun; etc... But really; they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence; so try not to let them stress you out. What should I do while I’m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes; draw diagrams; make notecards; and actively try to make sense of the material.,Advanced,?
