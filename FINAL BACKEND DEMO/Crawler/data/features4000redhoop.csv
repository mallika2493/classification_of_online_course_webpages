Why Hire a Virtual Assistant? In short; to save yourself time; money; and headache. As a small business owner; your most precious resource is your time. After all; each minute you spend is a minute you ll never see again. A virtual assistant is an investment in reclaiming that time so you can spend your time more wisely.

The Course Structure The course is broken up into 8 video PowerPoint segments that follow a trusted process I have used to much success in my own business. You ll be able to get through the modules quite quickly; but there is some homework involved; including: Tracking how you re currently spending your time Finding which tasks you can get off your plate Crafting and posting an attention-getting job description Narrowing down your applicant pool Testing and interviewing the most promising candidates If you re finding yourself overwhelmed or burned out with your work; there s a light at the end of the tunnel. It just takes a short investment in time to learn the basics of hiring a VA; and some additional time to train them on your process; but the long-term benefits are huge. This course is more geared toward hiring a virtual team member for ongoing business support; rather than for a one-off project; though much of the content will be applicable to both scenarios. The Deliverables: By the end of the course you ll have the confidence and skills to go out into the wild and hire your first virtual assistant.

The 21st century also opens up an ever-intensifying degree of social risks; relativity and uncertainty.        It is against this general background that the existing model of law and judiciary in China has been subject to cross-cutting pressures. A better analysis; understanding and reflection of the general social milieu thus becomes a matter of necessity should law-makers; law-enforcers; judges; prosecutors and lawyers seek better solutions in practice. An pragmatic adjustment of legal institutions to contemporary needs; be it by means of learning from other countries or of the trial-and-error process of innovation; will not be possible unless we are equipped with better social knowledge and greater familiarity with the history of thoughts.        Needless to say; the Chinese society is a super-large-scale complex system; of which cross-cutting social networks play an ultimately important role of self-organisation. Here; individual or group-based ways of conduct and thinking are culturally distinctive; albeit with consistent practical reason of universal implications – a basis upon which there arise such comparative-law prototypes as of the constitution of social norms; the design of legal institutions; judiciary practice; the awareness of rights; justice-related social psychology; and the mechanism of ordering. With a “law and society” perspective; this module aims to put the Chinese social structure and its function under microscopic observation through legal lens; while as its obverse; to interpret legal phenomena in the Chinese social context. In particular; daily routines; facts and concrete cases will be used to map the evolution of legal traditions; analyse the conditions for constituting a rule-of-law order; and reveal the value implications on our networked and risk society of a new rule-of-law paradigm with “principles” embedded within rational actions.  ,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Compilers; Coursera; online Math and Science courses,N/A,Online Course - Compilers,Coursera,Free,10 weeks,Yes,Alex Aiken; Professor,This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers; including lexical analysis; parsing; syntax-directed translation; abstract syntax trees; types and type checking; intermediate languages; dataflow analysis; program optimization; code generation; and runtime systems. As a result; you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed; programming language semantics; and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages. The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material; there will be in-lecture questions to answer; quizzes; and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result; such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code; or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education; and we re excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students. An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL; the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language; but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java. I hope you enjoy the course! Why Study Compilers? Everything that computers do is the result of some program; and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science; especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.,Appropriate for all,?

We have learned that exoplanets are extremely common objects in the Universe and that planetary systems are much more diverse than originally predicted. Our knowledge about exoplanets has dramatically increased thanks to the systematic monitoring of stars in the solar neighborhood by radial velocities; photometry; microlensing; and recently direct imaging; bringing valuable constraints to planet formation theories; as well as to models of planet interior structure; and atmosphere physics.

You may be a budding entrepreneur working with a business partner in the proverbial start-up garage; or as chef with kitchen and serving staff in a three star restaurant. You may be part of a globally dispersed team of engineers collaborating virtually on a new aircraft; a member of an online community collectively compiling a web encyclopedia; or a volunteer involved with a network of development aid workers supporting a community hit by humanitarian crisis. The success of any organization we are engaged in – especially when it brings together individuals from across borders and cultures – ultimately depends on how well we understand and are able to manage individual and collective behaviors.  All of us can contribute to improving the organizations we work in; and social science research can provide us with the tools to do so. Insights from psychologists; neuroscientists; sociologists and anthropologists; from communication scholars and from management scholars allow us to understand what shapes individual and group decision making; what enhances or weakens team performance; and how we can build and use our social networks. In addition; social science research has revealed systematic ways in which our behavior differs across cultural contexts – enabling us to more effectively work across borders. Learning about organizational behavior provides a great opportunity to develop your leadership skills and to reflect on your own behavioral tendencies. How do you usually make important decisions? What motivates you and how do you try motivating others? How successfully do you leverage and integrate diverse skills and views in a team? Do you prefer professional relationships with a close-knit group of trusted colleagues; or with a far-flung network of acquaintances from all walks of life? We are looking forward to welcoming you and supporting you on this journey of learning and self-discovery. ,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Break Into Freelance Writing With No Experience; Udemy; online Business courses,N/A,Online Course - Break Into Freelance Writing With No Experience,Udemy,$47,5 hours,Yes,Susan Finch,Make real money as a non-fiction freelance writer and live out your dreams of flexibility and redefine your career! You don t need a big blog following with loyal fans; be well-connected; or even have much talent to break into freelance writing. You also don t need dozens of clips to launch your new career to potentially command $1;000 a month as a new writer. And that s with the possibility to double your income as you gain experience. But it won t happen overnight. All you really need is to know how to come up with irresistible ideas; market them to the right people and be the type of freelancer everyone wants to work with. You also need some patience; ambition and determination. That s exactly how I earn between $100 on up to $1;500 an assignment. I can show you the ins and outs of breaking in; navigating your way to a client s inbox and landing work. So stop wasting your time paying dues and playing the  send and wait  game with query letters. There s a better way to launch a successful freelance writing career for magazines; websites; newspapers and more. I ve been a freelance writer for 10 years and have also worked as a video editor and Multimedia Director. And while I am persistent; none of the following worked for me in breaking into freelance writing and staying there. I DIDN T have connections in the publishing industry. I DIDN T have impeccable talent and writing skills. I didn t wait around to gather a lot of clips before breaking into markets like The LA Times. I DIDN T get an MFA or take a lot of writing workshops. I DIDN T break in with a bunch of high-end; glossy magazines. But I was also able to leverage clips in huge newspapers and big magazines in just a few short months (once I finally broke in). It took a few years to perfect my approach; but I ve gotten to a point now where I can just introduce myself and land work. And it s not just because of my clips; though I have those now. And it s not because I languished around in content mills. There s a reason why most reasonably talented writers spend years breaking in instead of just taking command and getting there. And the ones who seem to break through early all know the same thing about why talent is underrated and action is everything. MOST writers struggle for so long because it s completely overwhelming to know where to start and when to have enough faith to take bigger leaps into new markets. It s hard to think you can quit writing for peanuts and start landing lucrative clients to give you that flexibility and creative outlet you crave. Are you a frustrated freelance writer who is still: Sending out queries and waiting for weeks or months only to be rejected by a form letter? Trying to break into tiny markets with no success? Drowning in a sea of information with no idea how to track down the right people? Getting advice from everyone around you - even though they ve never tried to be a freelance writer? Or maybe got a few rejections and gave it up? Wondering why  real  writers consistently come up with irresistible ideas everyone wants? Afraid you ll never get ahead of your competition? Let s get brutally honest. It takes a lot more than talent to break into the world of freelance writing and more importantly - stay there. The most talented writers may never see their name in print without a few key steps to keep them ahead of the game. In fact; it s often less talented writers that continually land clients. What do they know that you don t? Learn how to develop a lasting craft that includes: Breaking into the industry without clips. Getting quality clips from reputable businesses and publications lightning fast! Learning what makes an intriguing query letter that commands attention. Leveraging creativity and flexibility to get ahead instead of writing talent. Stopping the cycle of fear and rejection and using your competition to do your homework for you. Studying a publication in minutes to determine if they re a good fit for your voice. Taking advantage of rejection and turning it into a success story. Tracking down the right people who will buy your work and learn who they really want to work with. Leveraging your life experience for success. It matters way more than your writing talent. Client building and pricing your way to potentially earning over $1;000 a month as a new writer and continually increasing your income. This course is delivered in animated video format with easy to use PDF transcripts. PLEASE watch the free videos before purchasing to make sure you enjoy the delivery format first. Everyone learns differently :-) **** I m a freelance writer with over 10 years of experience across travel guidebooks; iPhone app content; magazine articles; newspapers; websites and commercial scripts. I ve also worked as a naming consultant and video editor on national commercials and films. I earn a living freelance writing and thrive in doing creative work every day. But at the end of the day; what I really love doing is: Helping new writers crush obstacle and break into freelance writing - even if they ve never been able to before. But I didn t walk into my career with a roster of clients and assignments in hand. Instead I came stumbling into the arena and spent nearly 10 years breaking through with my first big clip and getting my freelance writing career rolling. Sure I had a few hits; but mostly misses; and couldn t figure out why I hadn t  made it.  It was endless years of frustration. I nearly lost hope that I would ever figure it out. Like many struggling freelance writers out there; I followed all of the traditional advice like sending out query letters and endless waiting. Nothing really worked. It felt like I was missing key pieces from a jigsaw puzzle. I could see the big picture; but not the pieces to get there. It wasn t until I stumbled upon a few key methods that I ended up skyrocketing my freelance writing success. It took a lot of trial and error that took years to perfect. I pulled all that knowledge together in one place to help you crush barriers (and your competition) in just a few short months. I write for a living and if I can t get my idea from A to Z then my whole family suffers. This is the livelihood I picked (and love!) to stay home with my daughter and still make ends meet. So I really didn t have a choice but to light a fire under myself and take some action. There s no sitting around waiting for an assignment to come to you; at least not in the early months and years of freelancing. You have to go out and take control of your career and build the life you want. Here s more to think about. Is writing a dying career? Hardly. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics; the median pay of writers was $55;940 and related employment is projected to grow 3 percent until 2022. Companies need content. They need web pages and case studies just to scratch the surface. And while magazines may move towards the web; editorial writing is still in demand. I have a little secret I share with you for how I tap dozens of magazines that are only known to select groups but pay more than many national publications. Think you need an advertising agency title to be a copywriter? You re wrong. If you don t think you re  qualified  to be a writer; think about this. Does the wine store down the street that needs some web copy and flyers want an expensive ad agency? Do they want to pay for a six-figure copywriter? No. All they want is a decent and reliable writer. And that s why just about anyone with reasonable talent and ambition can cobble together a freelance writing career without paying dues for years. Languishing away and torturing yourself over why you can t break into a market like the New York Times or People Magazine is a waste of time. It s pointless. Sure; you might break into a huge market on your first try; but there are a thousand other avenues that are easier; more profitable and usually yield a higher reward (like ongoing work). Your neighborhood alone probably has thousands of dollars in untapped writing revenue. Your city probably has editorial work ranging from glossy magazines to corporate pieces at nearby hospitals. And instead of going out there and asking for work; you re still hoping for a big break; even though the big break is right in front of you. By not acting; you re missing out acting on a dream and embracing that flexible lifestyle you crave. You can take your writing with you. You can work it into your career as a side income stream while continuing a part-time or full-time job. And if you re like me; you can stay home with your children while contributing financially and tapping into your creativity at the same time. The hard part is figuring out how to launch yourself and get started. There will be ups and downs; but once you have the techniques to land clients; you can keep applying it again and again while refining your approach. Let s get started. Who this course is for: Aspiring and struggling freelance writers looking to take break down fears and barriers and launch their careers. Writers with fluent English-speaking and writing skills. You won t achieve the same success from this program if you don t have reasonable skills. Writers who aren t afraid to dive right in and do the hard work necessary to succeed. Writers interested in learning about a variety of markets. While many techniques in this course will work for copywriting and corporate clients; it is not the main focus. Writers who are willing to take the time to develop their craft and learn the business without losing their patience after a few short weeks. Creative types who enjoy animated videos by way of learning. There are also PDF transcripts you can use. Who this course is NOT for: Non (fluent) English speaking writers. Seasoned and emerging writers already making a steady income from writing. Writers trying to break into fiction. Aspiring copywriters not interested in consumer journalism; magazine and web writing. Anyone who gives up after a few attempts or initial rejection. This course will take a few months to see consistent results and success is absolutely contingent on the work you put into it. This course is NOT a magic formula; it s simply a clear guideline to follow and tweak to suit your needs. Writers who can t put aside their fantasies about the freelance lifestyle to approach their work as a business. Writers who need information on setting up an online portfolio. * I cannot guarantee you will make a specific income from this course. Projections are based on my own experience and are contingent on your skills; ability and determination. * This course is delivered in animated video format with easy to use PDF transcripts. *** PLEASE *** watch the free videos before purchasing to make sure you enjoy the delivery format first.,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Publish Your Book On Kindle; Udemy; online Business courses,N/A,Online Course - Publish Your Book On Kindle,Udemy,$199,13 hours,Yes,Cathy Presland, One of the best courses I ve ever seen. This is by far one of the best courses that I have ever taken. The content is very thorough; the pacing is just right and the quality is excellent. I highly recommend this course if you are looking to publish your book in the Kindle store.   Best course ever! Cathy can explain everything related to creating; publishing and promoting ebooks MUCH better than everyone I ve seen. She covers all angles in this course. Take it; you ll love it; and will learn SO much.   This course goes insanely in depth on how to figure out the correct approach to every aspect of creating and launching your ebook. Can you write a book and upload it with some free online tutorial and without the need for this course? Sure! But with others taking this course; your book doesn t stand a chance at outselling them.  And I could go on – but these are all real student reviews and you can read them yourself on this page. My job right now is to explain what you re going to get inside this course and to help you move one step closer to getting your book finished. In this course; you will learn how to publish your ebook on Amazon s Kindle. But why would you want to publish your book on kindle? You might not realise it; but having a book is one of THE best ways to boost your credibility and establish yourself as an expert in your field. Just think about how YOU feel when someone tells you that they are a published author. And maybe even a bestselling author? It s also one of the best ways I have found of getting known. Making new connections and bringing people back to your website. And we also talk about good practice in asking those people to sign-up for your email list. And all at zero cost – no advertising; no need for complex SEO – your book is targeted at people who are already looking for your information. And the great thing is that they are buyers They have already bought your book and anyone in business knows that the value of a client or customer who wants the information or service you are offering and has paid for it – even the small price of a kindle book – is worth many times the value of someone just casually browsing. But maybe you already know this and you ve put off writing your book because it seems like such a big project? No problem – I have you covered! First of all a book for kindle is probably a lot shorter than you think. Maybe 10;000 to 20;000 words. Not the 50;000 words that a traditional business book might be and certainly not the 200;000 words a big fiction blockbuster would be. And I give you very clear structures so that the writing part is easy. I won t go so far as to say the book with write itself; but I do say that clear structures make for easy writing. Or maybe you really don t consider yourself to be a writer? Well; I m a writer myself and I think you re best served by publishing your own content - but if you re STILL not convinced you want to put pen to paper (or you don t have the time) then I give you ways to get your book done without writing a single word yourself. Oh but then it s so complex to actually publish an ebook... Not at all! Again and again students tell me how clear the material is and how the small steps I take you through make it manageable and actionable; whatever your level of knowledge.  It s All Here. ....well set out; easy to follow (particularly the contents page; and re-formatting the book for kindle; which can get quite complex; but very easy to follow along in this course) .... I have no hesitation recommending this course. Also regular updates; and an author who genuinely is there to support you; is priceless.   Cathy provides real value and takes you step by step through the process. This leaves me feeling that the result is achievable. I feel motivated and not overwhelmed.   This is one of the most helpful courses that I ve ever taken. The information is presented in a way that is clear and easily consumed.  I know that you can do it - and if you don t want to then I give you the best places to outsource some of these more technical or administrative tasks. And anyway who would want to hear what I have to say? Well people who are interested in your subject want to know what you have to say! And if you don t believe me; look at your own bookshelf or e-reader. Do you have more than one book on topics that you like to read about...? Do you buy another thriller or romantic fiction novel even though you just read a similar one last week...? I certainly do! Because what readers want is not just more information. They want information that is presented in a step-by-step fashion – maybe a  how to  book. Or they want a different take on the prevailing view? A reader will get more value out of your story or your perspective than you might think - and only you can tell that story. We all have something that is worth saying and I can t think of a better; faster or easier way to get your message out than with a digital book. Cathy; does your course just apply to non-fiction? All my techniques are tried and tested with my own books. As well as my main books; I have others that I write in a pen name just so that I can trial new techniques and keep up with what is working inside the Amazon platform. And although my books are non-fiction; I know these techniques work for fiction writers as well. Maybe the market is a little more crowded; and maybe you won t be a stand-out success with your first book; but the principles of what works are exactly the same.  VERY useful and practical. ...my book of short stories is already #1 in short stories category on Amazon UK... Strongly recommend to everyone who has or is planning to have a published kindle book. It definitely is worth the price!!!  So if you want to get your message into the world; expand your reach; build your brand and your business then I am here to show you easy and fast it is to become a published author.  ...I ve been on a lot of kindle webinars; listened to top authors talking about getting a book out there; and I have to say; this course beats them all....  Without agents and without publishers. Get your book published and selling – literally overnight If you have a story to tell; or you want to position yourself as the leading authority in your field. To stand out. To get that credibility that comes with having a book. To help people find out about your business and cement your expertise.  Fantastic course; delivering all that it promises. This course has some of the best content out there when it comes to publishing on kindle; or just about any sort of self publishing. Top quality sessions jam packed with useful content and actionable items topped up with motivation too....  Maybe you re a writer who wants to earn income from your writing? Or maybe you want to step into a speaking career and want a book to lead the way for you? Or maybe you have a wealth of knowledge and expertise and you can package it into training or coaching courses and have a book be a lead generation machine for you? Or maybe you re in a job and you want to write a book to help you stand out when you come to take that next step on the career ladder? Whatever your motivation and situation; this complete step by step course will show you exactly how to do that. You’ll learn: what book you should write - even if you think you already know - so that you reach more people how a book fits into your bigger picture. Whether it s to promote your business; whether it s purely for profit; and how you can lever it for new opportunities how to make the writing easy with frameworks to organise the content you already have productivity tips that mean you WILL finish that book! how to format your book with MS Word – no html or fancy software required (unless you want to be fancy and then we show you that too – but this is a stumbling block for many first-time authors so I have made it deliberately simple) all the details of cover design and even a step-by-step on commissioning your cover at my favourite design website how to position your book to sell on Amazon - everything you need to know - from categories to keywords insider pricing and promotion secrets to get sales - this alone can get you a bestseller without any additional marketing - I know - I ve tested it! nine ideas to take your business to the next level a bonus video on  what not to do  - learn from my mistakes advanced steps you can take in case you catch the publishing bug – it s contagious...  Jam packed ... has everything you need to know and more. This is a terrific course! Cathy Presland offers everything you need to know to not only get your book published but to get it ranking well within Amazon. She breaks down everything you need to know and do into bite-sized chunks and shows you how to do each step as you look over her shoulder. I particularly enjoyed her sharing pros and cons of different strategies; which are  optional ; which may be a waste of time etc. I m all for getting to the goal as quickly as possible! I ve seen courses in this area that offer much less value than this one does for a whole lot more money so whether you are just beginning on this journey or are already a published author looking for a few new strategies; you will get something from this course.  What if I have a question once I m inside the course? Inside the course there is a place to ask questions and get personal answers from me if there s anything at all you re not clear about. And I can promise that that kind of attention is worth the price of admission alone as they say :)  This is really good stuff. Cathy is very responsive to questions; and even revised a section to make it more clear.  So what are you waiting for? And if you STILL have questions you need answered before signing up; feel free to message me here on Udemy or over on facebook – I want this to be the right fit for you so that you get the absolute best results you can get. I really hope to see you inside so that you can get started with your book today!,Appropriate for all,?

Who’s your Protagonist? What’s his or her motivation? Don’t skimp on this lesson — your protagonist is your main character. You’ll learn to put your Antagonist in conflict with your Protagonist. And you’ll learn how to give him or her real dramatic power. And don’t forget he or she needs a fatal flaw; too. You’ll see… Create an entire cast of characters to add dramatic interest; style; texture; flavor; and a sense of reality to your novel…and some comic relief; too. Step 3: You’ll Structure Your Story You’ll understand the “Three Act Structure” and see a graphic demonstration of the “dramatic curve” that underlies virtually all great writings; movies; and even story-telling. You’ll discover the three classic points to cover in “Act 1” to hook readers as soon as they’ve read the first few pages. You’ll learn the secret of keeping your readers engaged and excited as your novel become more deeply developed and filled with dramatic tension in “Act 2.” And you’ll learn how to build to a dramatic; crashing conclusion in “Act 3”. Our “big finish” technique makes reading your book an experience your readers will not forget…and which just might bring you critical acclaim! Step 4: You’ll Create Your Manuscript You’ll discover why professional writers repeat “Scene and Sequel” throughout their novels; and why you should; too. No conflict? No novel. Learn why and how to create conflict three clever ways. Learn how to keep your readers’ suspense high without overdoing it. Discover the subtleties of keeping readers glued by weaving mystery into your writing. You’ll learn to regulate the “pace” of your novel so it moves smoothly without dragging or hurrying unnecessarily. Experiment with Viewpoint — learn three ways to present your tale’s “view” so you can choose the right one in the right situation. Learn to use Voice. Will you write with a light and airy voice; or a deep and resonant one? There’s much more in Step 4: You’ll discover Tense — learn tools to write in past; present or future. Setting — learn how to make your readers actually “see” your novel’s scenes. Learn about Dialogue — if your character’s from Maine; can you give her a Down East accent? And you’ll learn Beginnings and Endings: you need a strong start to your novel and a stronger end. Step 5: You’ll Learn to Polish your Manuscript • We’ll teach you our “Write Big” technique that can turn a flat novel into a sparkling success. And we’ll teach you to “Write Well” — editing secrets that help you use the right words and language; and cut out the wrong ones. • Step 6: You’ll Discover how to actually SELL Your Novel We’ll show you how to create the “collateral material” you need to promote and present your novel to publishers. You’ll receive our Manuscript Evaluation Checklist; your simple tool to make sure EVERYTHING’S ready for your publisher. And you’ll learn proven; insider secrets of how to actually get publishers to receive; review; and say “YES!” to publishing your novel!,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Learn How to Manage Anxiety; Udemy; online Health and Fitness courses,N/A,Online Course - Learn How to Manage Anxiety,Udemy,$49,2 hours,Yes,Kayce Mick,If you re here; chances are you are looking for a way to get rid of your annoying anxiety problem! Sometimes you know the cause; and other times you don t. Either way; my methods will WORK to lessen your anxiety; drastically. Hi. I’m Kayce; a Psychology Major (Honors B.A.); Teacher; Author; and Life Coach. I also know how anxiety feels. As a perfectionist and first born; I was extremely anxious as a child. However; when I was that young; I didn t realize I had an anxiety disorder. My body was struggling. My nervous system was a wreck. I felt uptight and on guard every waking minute. I couldn t sleep well at night and often found it hard to breathe... I was constantly sighing. If you sigh a lot... that s a problem! Whenever I tried getting massages or relaxing in a hot tub / Jacuzzi; the anxiety was a bit less; but my mind was still racing and I was still constantly worrying or thinking; so the anxiety never left. I was prescribed an SSRI which helped a lot; but the side effects made me feel like a zombie with no emotions. I was only 21 and didn t wanna spend the rest of my life as a zombie! Living with anxiety; panic and /or agoraphobia can be very challenging. Often others; even professionals; really don t understand how we think or feel and it is helpful to talk to get sound advice from someone who is walking the same walk as you are. I am offering affordable lessons to anyone who would like to have some assistance in learning to co-exist with their challenge. I can help you to learn to put the anxiety/panic in the background of your life so that you might go through your days as productively as possible. I have learned many techniques that have helped me enormously to deal with where I was at in my life at any given time. I d love to share them with you in the hopes that you can live up to your full potential just as you are each and every day. Often people suffering from anxiety disorders try to self-medicate with drugs or alcohol. I was one of them. I never told my friends of my anxiety disorder. Mental Illness still carries an embarrassing stigma; even in the year 2014! Also; no one wants to hear you’re not coping. It s hard for people to cope with those who are depressed or have some form of mental illness. Generally; if you show any signs of weakness people step away like you have the plague. From a young age; I decided to do a complete change of my life and get rid of my anxiety. I knew that if other people lived anxiety-free; so could I! So while obtaining my B.A. in psychology; I chose to take advantage of all the resources available to learn about how to eliminate anxiety. This was research from educational institutions; clinical psychology professors; and academic research journals. Since I wanted to become a clinical psychologist; I wanted to study how they cure anxiety disorders without the use of anti-depressant drugs. I didn t want to PAY to go see a psychologist or therapist. I was only a student. I wanted to do the  therapy  myself. You can have what I have There’s a little button at the top of this page which gives you access to the best of that knowledge. What have my clients said about me and my course? “Totally apprehensive; gave it a shot - LOVED it. Had tears in my eyes on more than 1 occassion. Kayce was fabulous and I would highly recommend her. I will continue to work with her =).  “I loved loved loved my coaching session!! I look forward to working with Kayce in the near future!!” “Kayce is very passionate about her work. She really get you to thinking. Looking for help in taking steps toward your new life with the right tools. Then this course is for you. Glad I didn t talk myself out of this course. Thank you Kayce!!!!!” Each section of my course offers some fun activities (I currently work as a high school teacher) to help you deepen your understanding and implement what you’ve learnt. As a live workshop; this material can sell for around $800-1000 per person! I’m not going to charge you anywhere near that; AND I will also be here by your side ready to answer your questions as you run through the course. Just shoot me a message! You don’t have to go through a life filled with anxiety any more. I can tell you from personal experience and from that of my clients; that getting anxiety down to a manageable state is LIFE CHANGING. Anxiety affects every area of your life. You will be healthier. You will sleep more soundly. You will have more energy every day. Your mind will be calmer; clearer and more focused. The relationships with those you care about will be happier and more successful. You will be more present with conversations You will have better intuition. You will be more in control and able to handle pressure I’ve helped a lot of people with these skills and I want to help you too so that you can start reducing your anxiety TODAY. This is your chance. Don’t lose the moment. Scroll to the top of the page and click TAKE THIS COURSE. I wish you all the happiness and success in the world!

Duration: 3 hours.  Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Learn music theory: ABRSM Grades 1 and 2; Udemy; online Music courses,N/A,Online Course - Learn music theory: ABRSM Grades 1 and 2,Udemy,$29,3 hours,Yes,Jose Salvatierra,Today; more and more people are wanting to learn music. Young children are learning to play the piano; guitar; violin; trumpet; and many more instruments. Music is very unlike any other activity. It is what lets you express every feeling with a simple change in volume or pitch; and captivate an audience after a single key press. This is; if you know what you re doing. In this course we will cover all of the fundamentals of music as per the ABRSM syllabus for Grades 1 and 2. In ~3 hours you could be covering the same content as usually is covered in a year of music lessons! Grade 1 The staff; notes; and rests. Writing a 2-bar rhythm as necessary for the Grade 1 exam. Tones and semitones Sharps; flats; and naturals Intervals and scales Chords: triad chords Grade 2 Quavers and semiquavers More time signatures (2/2; 3/2; 4/2; and 3/8) More key signatures Minor key signatures EXTRA only in this course: easily find the number of accidentals for a key signature without having to learn them by heart! Melodic and harmonic minor scales Commonly used terms and signs in music Also; in this course; there are lots of quizzes (one after each piece of content) for you to get all this music knowledge stick in your brain! I myself have been teaching and studying music for over 12 years; and there is one thing that I notice every time I get a new student: they got taught music theory all wrong. Many of them hated music theory! My method has always helped them get rid of that harmful dislike for what is one of the most important parts of music. Music theory is the basis of all music. Without it; you cannot understand music; and you cannot know what the composer wanted to convey and express. Therefore you cannot play the music and captivate that audience. Without music theory; you can play random notes and hope they sound well. Maybe you can spend hours to find the tune that sounds well. Knowing how the music works; and why some things sound well and some don t; will save you all this time and let you play brilliant sounding music from the get-go. You will even be able to do this while creating music on the go; and this is called improvising. However; I won t be teaching you how to play the piano in this course. This course is for students of all instruments; or if you are wanting to create electronic music but feel like you need a more solid grasp of the music fundamentals. It would even be extremely useful if you are a parent who wants to follow along with your kids so that you can help them if they get stuck; just like my mother helped me and my siblings when we were young. This course contains simple explanations since it is aimed for the very beginner in music. It covers all the necessary contents for students of Grades 1 and 2 in the ABRSM system; which is most common in the UK; US; Canada; India; Australia; Germany; and many other countries. Most likely there are ABRSM examinations available in your country. After each lesson; you will find a quiz that is there to aid in retaining the contents covered in each lesson. In addition; at the end of each of the two Grades covered there are sample exams to help you test yourself. Here s what other students are saying some of my other courses He is very down to earth; concise; and knowledgeable on the lectures he presents. I am looking forward to more advance courses from Jose -- keep up the wonderful work! -  Jay-Ar Jamon  Was nice and easy to follow for a beginner like me. I ll definitely be revisiting the course again to refresh my memory since it covered so many topics... -  Clara Chen ,Appropriate for all,?

Hardly what we would consider modern and appropriate for an industrial; commercial; urban culture! Courbet agreed; and so did his friend; the writer Charles Baudelaire who called for an art that would depict; as he called it; the beauty of modern life. Courbet painted the reality of life in the countryside—not the idealized peasants that were the usual fare at the exhibits in Paris. The revolution of 1848; in which both the working class and the middle class played a significant role; set the stage for Realism. Later; Manet and then Degas painted modern life in Paris; a city which was undergoing rapid modernization in the period after 1855 (the Second Empire).,Appropriate for all,?

But to understand the Roman Empire; you have to understand the man who made it possible. Julius Caesar was born in a time when the Roman Republic was barely hanging together; and he lives a singularly extraordinary life. Caesar conquered Gaul; the territory that today is known as France; then returned to Rome to take absolute control of the largest nation in the western world and finally died in betrayal on the very floor of the Senate. But this was all at the end of Caesar s life; the culmination of his 55 years. What happened before? Caesar was 40 when he set off for Gaul; and he d already done more than most Roman politicians did in their entire lives. He d been captured by pirates; struck alliances with the largest names in Rome; and already been a wildly successful military leader. Understanding this part of Caesar s life is key to understanding the rest of it; as this is when Caesar becomes the man who is able to do such great things later. This is Caesar s prologue; his origin story; and it s a fascinating tale. This course is the first of what will be a three-part series covering the entire life of one of the greatest men in history. It is an exhaustive overview of Caesar s early life with about 1.5 hours of video content. In addition; purchasing this course will get you 66% discounts on the next two chapters of Caesar s life (coming soon!).,Appropriate for all,?

Despite a lifetime of hard work; small business owners; consultants and ‘corporate escapees’ often find themselves underpaid; undervalued and under recognised. Each speaker delivers a potent 40 minute talk separated into different lectures; to arm you with simple and proven methods for becoming highly valued; highly paid and recession proof no matter what your industry of expertise. Section 1) The art of the perfect pitch; taught by Mike Harris and Marcelo Bravo. Do you have a compelling answer if we asked you ‘What do you do ? In today’s market; being remarkable is essential. If you don’t have an amazing pitch; regardless of how great your product or service is; you will always struggle Mike Harris is one of the few people in the world to have grown more than one Multi-£B business. He was founding CEO of internet-only bank Egg; where he took it from concept to £B public company in 2 years. He was founding CEO of world’s first telephone-only bank Firstdirect which later sold to HSBC and between 1991-1995 was CEO of Mercury Communications where he created a new consumer business which later sold to NTL (now Virgin Media) for £2.5bn. Mike is the author of Find Your Lightbulb and speaks on innovation for some of the UK’s largest businesses. In 2005 he co-founded Garlik; the UK’s leading supplier of software/services to protect from online crime and identity theft; before selling to Experian in 2011.

Marcelo has founded or co-founded four companies since he immigrated to the UK 12 years ago. He has taken two of these companies public in the past four years; one in advanced materials; the other in pharmaceutical technology; both operating internationally and raising over £15m in funding. One of his companies went into administration. The lessons from his successes and; more importantly; from his failures; have shaped his approach to business. Section 2) Publish your ideas; taught by Mindy Gibbins-Klein Talented but stuck on a treadmill? Whether via a blog; articles or even a book; getting your ideas out there is very powerful. And it’s not as hard as you may think. Once you have a clear framework; you will find it easy to start filling in the gaps.

Mindy Gibbins-Klein has helped over 300 people become published authors and she will show you how attainable it is to write and publish your book. As a published author; potential customers are pre-sold before seeing you. Your rates go up; opportunities multiply and you are seen as an expert in your field. The years ahead are set to be very kind to people who are “experts” (as a global market has now opened up). Section 3) Productise your value; taught by Nic Rixon Experiencing sales burnout? Until you turn your soft skills and talents into tangible products; you will always have to show up to earn a living. As a successful entrepreneur with a group of companies in manufacturing; property; training and commercial design; Nic Rixon knows about the challenges of growing a successful business and managing people.

Section 5) Develop winning partnerships; taught by Steve Bolton and Julia Langkraehr If you stop; will your business stop? For the founders of most service businesses; they ARE the business. They sell; deliver and service by day; and do admin by night. The ultimate goal is to package your value so others can leverage it. Steve Bolton is an inspirational; unconventional and highly successful entrepreneur; who has become one of the UK’s leading experts in turning novice property investors into millionaires in record time.

Some of them have to do with events of great importance; such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales; and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome; as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals; societies; and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear; though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigate these questions through a variety of topics; including the creation of the universe; the relationship between gods and mortals; human nature; religion; the family; sex; love; madness; and death.,Appropriate for all,?

The Near Life Experience is the life of the Rat Race. You have a well paid; but unfulling job; that is crushing your spirit & thwarting your dreams Despite your succesful career you still feel a deep sense of lack; as if something visceral & passionate was missing from your life You know your life has a purpose; but you can t seem to get clarity on what that purpose actually is The worst aspect of the Near Life Experience and the Rat Race is that it leads to what Hospice workers have identified as  The Number 1 Regret of the Dying ...  I wish I d had the courage to live a life true to myself and not the life others expected of me  Is that where you re headed? It doesn t have to be. The Art of Meaning course will teach you the 3 uncommon skills that empower you to stop running the Rat Race and experience the alternative. The adventure of life. Why run in a race against billions of people; that you re never going to win; when you can live life as a daring adventure? Seriously why? When you think about it; It doesn t make sense does it? Unless we re afraid. Then it makes sense. The Art of Meaning course will show you how to face your fears; how to stop running and start daring and adventuring. This course will instruct you in 20 transformational practices that transform the Near Life Experience into a Meaningful Life Experience. 1. Making your current work so fulfilling and inspiring that your spirit soars...or creating work that is so inspiring and fulfilling that your soul sings! 2. Filling the exsitential gap and it s unscratchable itch and finding that visceral; passionate; significant  something  that s missing from your life 3. Discovering your true purpose in life 4. Living a life that is true to yourself; not the life others expect of you In this course you will learn to: Notice that your incessant mental dialogue (or Program) is preventing you from experiencing the unbearable lightness of being (what the Mystic Poet Rumi calls  The Beloved ) which will amplify this ecstatic experience in your everyday life Feel the Presence of the Genius State of Mind (what poets call  The Muse ) and consistently tap into this unending source of inspiration and creativity Make Meaningful (what Neuroscientists call  Reframing ) the mundane; negative or even traumatic events of your life by exercising your fundamental and ONLY true human freedom. The Art of Meaning is a Multidimensional Multimedia course consisting of over 10 hours of Instruction. There are 5 sections with a total of 35 Lectures 14 Video Lectures - containing Epic Tragicomic Poetic Tales/Case Studies of real world Art of Meaning Practice (where you learn from my mistakes) 8 Powerpoint Lectures - containing 4 Assignments & 14 simple practices to ground & integrate the 3 uncommon skills into your daily life (tried & tested on yours truly) 5 Audio Lectures - which elaborate the finer points of the Art and provide my 10 most powerful tips; tricks & tools for normalising & amplifying the unbearable lightness of being & the Genius State of Mind in your life (the ones that work like Gangbusters) 7 Quizzes - which will test the depth & clarity of your understanding of the Art (to make sure you re paying attention) 1 Couse Guide Document Lecture - which will help you stay clear and focused on exactly what to do; how to do it; when to do it and how often 1 2 hour Live Q&A/Coaching Session per month - Plus I ll generally answer all your questions within 48 hrs On Average each hour of Instruction should take 1-3 weeks to work through; so the course can be completed in as little as 13 weeks or 1 Quarter. However The Art of Meaning is designed to fit into your schedule; not the other way around; so you can start & stop it whenever you need to and you can take as long as you like to complete it. There is no danger of overwhelm with this course. Why would you take this course instead of one of the many Lifestyle courses on Udemy? The unbearable lightness of being & The Genius State of Mind The unbearable lightness of being is the name I ve given to the sublime ecstatic WoWness that all healthy babies express when they unaccountably and spontaneously fill-to-the-brim-bursting with the uncontrollable bliss of just being. Obviously if all healthy babies experience the unbearable lightness of being; healthy adults can too; but just like most adults I had only experienced it very rarely. Until that is; my life completely fell apart and I ended up living under a tree in a park. Of course then I started to experience it everyday. Oh the irony! Just like a newborn baby; I became visibly; viscerally aware of the miracle of being. For a moment I stopped taking for granted the miracle of my existence and was transported to paradise by the realisation that nothing is more amazing; more mysterious; more magical; more miraculous; more utterly WOW! than existence itself. When you think about it; gratitude for existing must be the default state of being; of all beings! Life is the ultimate gift. Nothing beats being. And so lying underneath all our experiences of  this isn t enough/this isn t good enough  is the basic background frequency of gratitude just for the ability to experience something as  not enough  or  not good enough ... in other words; underneath it all is what Rumi called The Beloved...and I call; the unbearable lightness of being. Isn t it funny that it often seems to takes  losing it all  to realise this default state of gratitude? Well not anymore. Unlike me; you don t have to lose it all...or have a Near Death Experience (I m a bit slow on the uptake; so I needed both;)...to experience the mundane everyday yet singularly spectacular WOW!ness of the unbearable lightness of being. You just have to do this course. On Genius People say that the word Genius is overused. I say it’s underused. From the Art of Meaning perpsective Genius doesn’t belong only to a few rare people. Genius is something that a few rare people enjoy all the time and everyone else enjoys some of the time. This is a different way to look at Genius. It sees Genius not as a type of person; but as a State of Mind; a Level of Consciousness; a Field of Awareness; a Sublimely Ecstatic Frequency. From this perspective anyone can feel the presence of the Genius State of Mind; as long as they know how to tune into it. I lived under that tree in the park for 7 months between April & October 2002 and after the first 2 months I d normalised my experience of the unbearable lightness of being and I began to feel the presence of the Genius State of Mind on a daily basis. This expressed itself as performance poetry pouring out of me; for the first time ever at the age of 35...and up until then I didn t consider my self to be a  creative  person and had never written a poem in my life! For the last 11 years I ve been both experimenting with and instructing other people in Noticing the unbearable lightness of being and being present to the Genius State of Mind and I ve found that they are Universally accessible...everyone can experience them and anyone can use them...in fact 98% of 5 year olds exhibit the Genius State of Mind; until that is; our education system socialises it out of us! I ve worked with everyone from High School Students to House Wives; people with serious Brain Injuries to Yoga Teachers; Authors to Economists...and if they can get down with the unbearable lightness of being & Genius State of Mind; then you can too! And the way to  get down  with them is through the 3 uncommon skills. The Art of Meaning course will teach you the dance steps. I d like to invite you to join us in our dance with the unbearable lightness of being and the Genius State of Mind...so that like young Ricky Fitts in the film  American Beauty  you ll feel that...  Sometimes there s so much...beauty...in the world...I feel like I can t take it! And my heart...is just going to...cave in  The writer of that brilliant film knows EXACTLY what I m talking about. You can remind yourself of that exquisite scene (and what s in store for you on this course) here Absolutely no risk to you Thanks to Udemy s 30 day money back guarantee you can take the course for up to 4 weeks and if it doesn t live up to it s billing or you find that it s just not for you; simply ask Udemy for your money back. There s no risk...financially speaking. You do however run the risk of avoiding the  Number one regret of the dying  by having the courage to live a life that s true to yourself and not the life others expect of you. So I look forward to seeing you inside; the other side; of The Art of Meaning. Honestly; why wouldn t you want to flirt with the fierce foetal feeling of the unbearable lightness of being...and have a fulfilling fling with the fabulous fun fountain of the Genius State of Mind? You don t just have to take my word for it. Here s what people just like you; have to say about The Art of Meaning & other Inspiration Engineered; Inspiration Technologies...  I went to one of Chris Paradox s Art of Meaning workshops in 2009 and it has had a deeply profound influence on how I ve lived my life since; and how I now perceive the world and those around me. So much so that I dedicated a number of pages in my book  The Moneyless Man to The Art of Meaning and it s subsequent impact on me.  Mark Boyle - Author of The Moneyless Man  & Founder of Freeconomy: The world s largest online gift economy Chris is a brilliant and superbly creative writer; performer and workshop leader. If you re looking for an intelligent; articulate; inspirational and engaging experience...you ve found it!   Bob Harris - Independent Consultant Psychotherapist  Chris is an exceptional human being with an extraordinary story. Chris is a poet; a philosopher; a messenger and a teacher with a great sense of purpose and belief in humanity. He is warm; gentle; fun; thoughtful; strong; determined; clear thinking; insightful and passionate about helping people to fulfill their human potential and live legendary lives. He believes that by raising people s consciousness and encouraging and helping them to be their own heroes; each person will make a positive impact upon the world. Chris touches everyone he meets and works with and you are never quite the same again - something shifts. Inspired by Victor Frankl; Chris is a real life example of someone who chose to respond to adversity as both the best thing that ever happened to him as well as the worst thing that ever happened to him; when he lost his leg in an accident whilst in a travelling circus in Mexico. Chris continues to embrace the paradoxity of life and has become known as Chris Paradox. Watch this man; or better still attend one of his workshops or sign up for some e-learning. You won t be disappointed! On a personal note I am glad to be able to count Chris as a dear friend and wish him all the best in his future adventures.  Caroline Adair - Associate Account Director for MotivAction Group Plc  I highly recommend Chris. He has been on a fearless journey himself and this in itself is inspirational. He is very heart oriented and with a great deal of caring; love and humour encourages and facilitates others to do what they didn t think they could do. His workshops are an enjoyable and often very touching experience for all involved and he is a great appreciator of vulnerability and therefore strength both in himself and others.  Trish Young - Independent Information Services Professional  Chris is a very inspiring teacher and performer. Whatever he choses to speak about is sure to make you think about and question your current position. He does this in an inclusive way; without making you think that you are wrong - but more that perhaps there are also other ways. I would highly recommend seeing him perform or going to his workshops.  Dolly May - Voice & Dialect Coach at Masters Performing Arts College  Through Chris Paradox s workshop; I learnt that our true purpose does not come with a societal status or a financial reward attached; but that the rewards of bringing your true self to the world will certainly bring so much more richness and depth of being into all aspects of your life. I discovered that my own purpose was to experience and expand my capacity to love - I think I had always known this really; but it never seemed enough; so I had maybe thrown it to the side and waited for a different Earth changing mission. However on rediscovery at the workshop; I truly understood what this purpose meant to me and I knew I actually had the greatest purpose I could have ever wished for. There was just much to explore; to share; to bring to life and to experience. It is such a real blessing indeed to be able to hold and honour my own gifts. I truly hope that many more people can experience their own unique purpose and benefit from what Chris is offering to the world. He truly is the real deal; a crazy; poetic; angel magician and a very special soul purpose activator indeed . Thank you millions xxx  Shakti Tracy - Diamond Energy Practioner & Mother  I honestly wouldn t have ended up here without you. I was in a really bad way physically; mentally; spiritually; the symbols and insights you gave me became rungs on a ladder to climb out of that pit. Can t thank you enough. So excited to embark on this next stage. All the time during the last seven years I have been focussed on getting to this point... I never really thought about the  then what? . Thanks for; once again; turning up at the right time to nudge me in the right direction.  Magnus Stokoe - Award winning Artist Jeweller @Magnus & Bell,Appropriate for all,?

So if you re looking how to get started with Joomla 3 quickly and easily; you re in the right place. Just because it s free doesn t mean that you get a cut-down down version of another course. Yes; I do have some advanced courses; but this comprehensive beginner course teaches you all the essential Joomla concepts so you can get your first website built in record time. I started building websites in 1995 and when content management systems came along; I hated them. The designs were awful; you were forced to change the way you worked and the documentation was woeful. Even simple things like creating a page made no sense. The problem is that most people try to learn by watching a couple of videos and reading a few tutorials. That s what I did which only led to frustration. Learning Joomla is a bit like building a brick wall. Many beginners have a basic foundation - they understand the essentials of websites. Then they start piling on a few bricks here and there. But as their wall of knowledge is constructed; it s full of holes. Eventually they hit a point where their wall can t sustain any more weight and it collapses. What a waste of time! This course takes a step-by-step approach to building Joomla websites. Each lesson builds upon the previous one; so your wall is solid. So whether you re looking to save money by building your own website; or if you re an existing web developer needing to learn Joomla; you are in the right place. Join the thousands of students who have taken this course by enrolling today. Remember that a comprehensive workbook with loads of screenshots is included to save you time.

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,How to Build a WordPress Form Using the Gravity Forms Plugin; Udemy; online Technology courses,N/A,Online Course - How to Build a WordPress Form Using the Gravity Forms Plugin,Udemy,$27,2 hours,Yes,Adam W. Warner,How to Build a Form? This is the exact question we get asked almost daily by our WordPress website clients. Our answer has always been “…get the Gravity Forms plugin.” Why? Before the Gravity Forms plugin existed we used a variety of freely available plugins for WordPress that allowed us to build web forms but we quickly reverted to creating our own custom web forms as soon as something more robust than a simple “Contact Us” form was needed. Then Gravity Forms was Released by Rocketgenius. When we first became aware of Gravity Forms back in 2010; our first thought was “why do we need to buy a plugin to build website forms when we already have free ones available; and if needed; we could simply code our own?” But that thought quickly faded as we took a closer look at the features and capabilities of the Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress. Not only does it provide a simple interface for building web forms; but it also provides incredible tools for creating very advanced web forms; all with a simple point and click interface. Why We Created This How to Build a Form Video Tutorial Course. Since purchasing the developer license of the Gravity Forms plugin and using it on our sites and those of our clients; we have have been nothing but impressed with both the ease of use and also the support that the folks at Rocketgenius provide. Not only that; but they are continually developing this plugin and adding new features requested by customers. However; although there is a lot of written documentation provided to purchasers of this plugin; we are visual learners and do much better when seeing something in action rather than reading through a “how to build a form” series of web pages. It wasn’t just us. Because we own the developer license and we use this on many clients sites; there were numerous times when site owners wanted to use the plugin to create an additional web form for their business and didn’t know how to use Gravity Forms. It was then that we started including “how to build a web form” videos for our clients; and it turned out that they were visual learners too. Seeing it in action allowed them to “just get it”. Maybe you’re a developer or site owner with the same set of problems? Then this course is for you.,Appropriate for all,?

Cloud Computing  is more than a buzzword. All of the systems required to run a company are available now.  The huge time-and-cost roadblock of old fashioned IT is gone - for the companies that grab the opportunity.  This course will teach you how. My aim in this course is to give business owners a blueprint for building and running their business on SaaS ( Software as a Service ) solutions. It s not a technical course for cloud-computing IT professionals. It s a pragmatic approach to evaluating; selecting and running cloud systems for business use. Some technical terms are unavoidable; so by design; the course materials are all visual; to help grasp the concepts and connections even if the terms are unfamiliar.  When I mention specific companies and services; it s not a  commercial endorsement  - it s my opinion; based on firsthand use. You won t find this approach to business cloud-computing spelled out in any single book; because I haven t written it yet.  I run two successful businesses this way; with a business partner and employees.  We ve made mistakes; refined; evaluated and learned the hard way.  Watching these lessons will; I hope; save you a few years of the same challenges and let you focus on your business! This is just a better way to get systems that support running and growing business.  If you don t agree; or if it doesn t work for your specific business; contact me within 30 days and I ll happily refund your course fee.  ,Appropriate for all,?

The instructor has decided to teach the course in Mandarin on Coursera; while the slides of the course will be in English to ease the technical illustrations. We hope that this choice can help introduce Machine Learning to more beginners in the Mandarin-speaking world. The English-written slides will not require advanced English ability to understand; though. If you can understand the following descriptions of this course; you can probably follow the slides. [???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????] Machine learning is an exciting field with lots of applications in engineering; science; finance; and commerce. It is also a very dynamic field; where many new techniques are being designed every day; and the hot techniques and theories at times can rise and disappear rapidly. Thus; users of machine learning from other fields often face the problem of choosing or using the techniques properly. In this course; we emphasize the necessary fundamentals that give any student of machine learning a solid foundation; and enable him or her to exploit current techniques properly; explore further techniques and theories; or perhaps to contribute their own in the future. The course roughly corresponds to the first half-semester of the National Taiwan University course  Machine Learning ; and the second half-semester is expected to be on Coursera under the name  Machine Learning Techniques  soon in the future. Based on five years of teaching this popular course successfully (including winning the most prestigious teaching award of National Taiwan University) and discussing with many other scholars actively; the instructor chooses to focus on what he believes to be the core topics that every student of the subject should know. The students shall enjoy a story-like flow moving from  When Can Machines Learn  to  Why ;  How  and beyond.,Appropriate for all,?

Here s what this is about: My name is Steve Goldberg. I ve been testing; failing; improving; and refining ways to make passive income online for the past 4 years. And in this entertaining course; I m going to let you peek over my shoulder as I setup a live passive income stream and you will see me make money at the end of the course! This is not theory. This is authentic; real-world; look over my shoulder training that gives you every detail of exactly what to do. In fact; I just added another lecture as a bonus that walks you through how I created just one simple video that makes $360 per month! What s In The Course? This is a course which includes over 20 easy to follow; step by baby step videos in which you will learn exactly how to make passive income online without your own product or website; how to find money-making products to promote as an affiliate; how to get free traffic; how to track your results; and how to setup multiple passive income streams in your spare time. Who Is This For? The class is perfect for total beginners who are new to making passive income; affiliate marketing; and making money online. The course is structured in Powerpoint overview videos; and look-over-my-shoulder screen capture videos. What You Will Do: Your class project will be to find a product to promote as an affiliate; create a press release; submit your press release; and get traffic to your press release to make passive income. It will cost between $75-$150 to setup your first passive income stream; which could potentially make you $200; $300; maybe $500 per month. No guarantees though. Results may vary depending on your effort. Why Take This Course? Since many people struggle with information overload when searching for a way to generate passive income; I kept these videos very short and to the point. I assume you know nothing and explain everything in simple terms so even a fifth grader with bad English can do this. How Available Am I? I ll be available about once or twice per week to answer any questions you might have. I ve designed the course so even people with little internet experience can get results without any outside help. Does This Really Work? Yes! You will see every step from start to finish. Then at the end of the course; I show you the first sale I made in my real account to prove this works. There is no theory. No fluff. Just clear; simple steps to take. P.S. I ve just created another Bonus Lecture about making passive income from YouTube. This lecture goes over how I created a YouTube video that makes $360 per month on autopilot with no work involved.,Appropriate for all,?

Unlike conventional public economic courses that concentrate on taxation and public expenditures; I will offer a modern multidisciplinary perspective of government as an economic agent. The course will summarize a vast body of empirical evidence from around the world as to what factors make governments more or less efficient. Of primary interest will be the agency relations between government and society; i.e. ways and means to ensure government accountability and prevention of the abuse of power. Accordingly we will discuss the impact of constitutions and political regimes on government performance. The course will also deal with how the size of government and state capacity affect development; and how those evolve over time. We will discuss proper scope of government – what programs and services the state should administer itself; and which of those should better be outsourced to private firms – perhaps in the private-public partnership format. An important theme of the course will be the choice of appropriate tools for government intervention; and in particular - the tradeoff between public regulation; by  resolving disputes by courts; and by opting for self-regulation and other private sector mechanisms.  We will discuss government pathologies; most and foremost corruption and ways and means to keep it under control. The dual role of civil society as an alternative to government and factor of government accountability will be explored. ,Appropriate for all,?

We tend to make everyday economic decisions – what to buy; what job to choose; how to save ones income – without complicated calculations; instead relying on common sense. Unfortunately; common sense does not always appear to be enlightened and trained enough. Economic conceptions; with which we think; were shaped in different epochs and often bear not that very sense we tend to put into them. We sometimes accumulate money in a way our predecessors did; although at that time it was gold or silver; while now we deal with just paper. We easily refer to GDP; being hardly aware of complexities behind this notion. We believe to politicians promising to make our life wealthy and happy; not distinguishing reliable promises from those just fooling us.  History of economic thought is a distillation of experiences in solving complicated problems of economic life – experiences that were shaped in struggle of ideas with conflicting social interests behind them. In our course we summarize lessons of outstanding economic thinkers; such as Adam Smith and Karl Marx; Leon Walras and Joseph Schumpeter; Torstein Veblen and Nikolai Kondratieff; John M. Keynes and others. We shall analyze how responding to the challenges of their times they created the corps of our economic knowledge with its powers and limitations. Thus we hope to make your economic common sense more enlightened and better trained.,Appropriate for all,?

We will discuss concepts like ·Gantt Charts ·Dependencies ·Baselines ·Progress Tracking ·Work Breakdown Structure ·Top Down Planning ·Critical Path Analysis Explaining and then using these concepts and approaches to build a simple example project plan in Microsoft Project 2010. The steps discussed can be applied to any version of MS Project and are also valid in other project planning software tools. It is not necessary to have MS Project 2010 installed but using the examples covered in some form of planning tool will aid the students. Students are guided through each of the concept areas building layers of understanding and introducing context to each subject discussed; starting from the Gantt Chart and a review of Henry Gantt’s idea to communicate plans; confirming how modern planning approaches seek to represent and control the dependencies between tasks. Moving on to discuss how the project plan is a valuable and useful communications tool both within the project team and outwardly to stakeholders and senior management. Students will take a look at how the plan when effectively tracked can improve estimating and delivery for future stages and what steps might be taken to re-plan the project as a result of items tracked. Once the basic concepts have been covered students can see how these might be applied to an example but simple project; using a top down planning approach and giving a simple and easy assemble of the project plan. The resulting plan shows how resources are assigned and provides an outline cost profile for the project. The material covered will provide a solid foundation for future project planning; and further training in project management; leaving students with enough knowledge to build and track plans in their own projects.,Appropriate for all,?

Duration: 10 weeks.  Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Natural Language Processing; Coursera; online Math and Science courses,N/A,Online Course - Natural Language Processing,Coursera,Free,10 weeks,Yes,Michael Collins,Natural language processing (NLP) deals with the application of computational models to text or speech data. Application areas within NLP include automatic (machine) translation between languages; dialogue systems; which allow a human to interact with a machine using natural language; and information extraction; where the goal is to transform unstructured text into structured (database) representations that can be searched and browsed in flexible ways. NLP technologies are having a dramatic impact on the way people interact with computers; on the way people interact with each other through the use of language; and on the way people access the vast amount of linguistic data now in electronic form. From a scientific viewpoint; NLP involves fundamental questions of how to structure formal models (for example statistical models) of natural language phenomena; and of how to design algorithms that implement these models. In this course you will study mathematical and computational models of language; and the application of these models to key problems in natural language processing. The course has a focus on machine learning methods; which are widely used in modern NLP systems: we will cover formalisms such as hidden Markov models; probabilistic context-free grammars; log-linear models; and statistical models for machine translation. The curriculum closely follows a course currently taught by Professor Collins at Columbia University; and previously taught at MIT.,Appropriate for all,?

Here’s how: Introducing Travel Hacking: An in-depth course on how to use award travel to eliminate your biggest travel expenses. Being a travel hacker means having the ability to travel anywhere you want… without breaking the bank. I’m Huntly Mayo – seasoned travel hacker; personal finance blogger; and lifestyle entrepreneur. Over the past few years I’ve enjoyed the immense benefits of travel hacking – mainly traveling the world for next to nothing. Along the way I discovered some things you probably already know: there are so many great reasons to travel… Exposure to exciting and new experiences! Escape from the stress of everyday life! Build relationships with your loved ones and friends Meet new; interesting people Learn about new cultures (or more about your own!) Enjoy authentic; delicious food ...And more! But traveling; especially to those far off; exotic places; usually costs a lot of cash. Unless you’re a travel hacker… So... What’s Travel Hacking? Put simply; it s a way to secure airlines tickets; hotel stays; and lodging; for far below market prices. Travel Hacking involves leveraging loyalty programs; your own value as a consumer; and a variety of strategies and tactics to earn and redeem award travel. Over the last couple of years I’ve spent hundreds of hours experimenting and optimizing to create a travel hacking system… That’s brought me all over the globe; from Thailand to Paris; Argentina to Egypt; Greece; and more… AND it’s given me the opportunity to bring others along with me; and even send some of my own family members on trips of their own. All through travel hacking and at almost no out of pocket cost. I’ve packed everything I’ve learned along the way into this course; including a proven system for travel hacking your way to any destination you can think of. Here’s a taste of what you get with the course: A Step by Step Framework for getting you to your dream destinations for next to nothing Tested Strategies for finding and booking international flights with total cash costs of under $25 Advanced Travel Hacking Tactics for securing completely free flights Detailed Video Walkthroughs of how to execute those tactics and strategies Course Practical: You ll book your own practice trips during the class... Because experience is the BEST teacher Continued Lecture Updates to cover major developments in the travel hacking landscape ...And much more So if you’re interested in experiencing all that travel has to offer; without paying all it “has” to cost; you’re ready to become a travel hacker… But there is one piece of bad news… This course is not available to everyone. If you want to find out if you qualify; watch the free; short introduction video to the class. One more thing… This course comes with a rock-solid 30-day guarantee on your investment. But wait; doesn’t Udemy already have that on all their classes? Yes - And I’m adding mine as an extension to that; for an effective 60 day guarantee. That’s how confident I am in the value this course delivers. If you don’t benefit from the travel hacking system covered in this course; and it’s past the 30 day Udemy refund period and within 60 days of when you signed up; send me an email and show me you’re executing the material and not getting results. I’ll happily refund 100% of what you’ve paid for the course. So watch the introduction video to see if you qualify; then sign up today risk free to start your travel hacking journey. See you soon; Huntly Mayo P.S. The initial course price of $79 is a short term offering to build students and positive reviews.

Each of the next five weeks is geared to U.S. foreign policy in different regions: Asia with a particular focus on U.S.-China relations; the Middle East and such issues as Iran; Arab-Israeli peace; Syria; and the Arab uprisings; relations with Western Europe and Russia; relations in the Western Hemisphere with Latin America and Canada; and key issues in U.S.-Africa relations.

In this class; I cover the first reader in the Fabulae Faciles; by providing audio files; guided study; supplementary materials; and; more important; a constant and consistent presence as you work you way through the passages.,Appropriate for all,?

The Method This course takes an analytical approach to cartomancy which means you’ll learn to read the cards using a logical; step-by-step process.

Through your readings; you will help yourself and your clients: ·  Perceive the present more clearly ·  Understand hidden influences ·  Uncover blocks and obstacles ·  Find solutions ·  See how the future may unfold What You Will Learn in this Course First; you get the basics; which means understanding the parts of a standard playing card deck; guidelines for cartomancers; and learning to shuffle and select cards. Next; you’ll learn what each card represents. Then; you’ll discover new techniques to gain more information from the cards to add important details to your readings in this tarot card reading course. Masterfully; you will learn to pull precise details from the cards revealing physical descriptions (“Your future romantic partner has a dark complexion--perhaps of African American; Latin; East Indian; heritage. He’s stocky in build and he has facial hair”); and timing of events (“A job offer will be presented in the 2nd week of spring”). Take this course and become a fortune teller in 7 days!,Appropriate for all,?

Biology is moving from molecular to modular. As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists of molecules (proteins; lipids; ions) involved in cellular processes; we need to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that act as discrete functional systems. These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal transduction; transcription; motility and electrical excitability. In turn these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion; proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular and cellular systems? What are the mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these systems? The course will develop multiple lines of reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads are: the design; execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning; models and simulations. Examples will be discussed to demonstrate “how” cell- level functions arise and “why” mechanistic knowledge allows us to predict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.,Appropriate for all,?

Twenty years ago; we had no idea whether any of the countless stars out there beyond our solar system had planets or not. Today; things are totally different. Over one thousand planetary systems have been discovered. The universe is teeming with planets. And what strange planets they are - hot Jupiter-like planets skimming the surfaces of their stars; cold and lonely free-floating planets far from any star; planets made of diamond; planets with rain made of glass; super-Earths and even planets orbiting neutron stars. In this course we’ll bring you up-to-date with the latest research on exoplanets; and how it has revolutionised our understanding of the formation of solar systems like our own. This course is designed for people who would like to get a deeper understanding of these mysteries than that offered by popular science articles and shows. You will need reasonable high-school level Maths and Physics to get the most out of this course. This is the second of four ANUx courses which together make up The Australian National University s first year astrophysics program. It follows on from the introductory course on the Greatest Unsolved Mysteries of the Universe. It is not necessary to have done the introductory course first: all necessary background material is repeated here.

Yoga teacher and Quantum Physics Coach Teagan Fea and music composer Angel Sananda will take you virtually on an incredible Meditation Retreat for 10 days; a journey that could change your life. Over the years I have taken 100 s of people away on yoga retreats.  For those lucky enough to afford this luxury; this has been a life changing experience. For many however; it is not possible to go away on Meditation Retreat because of financial and other commitments. This is why this I have developed a retreat that you can do in the comfort of your own home. Are you aching to find time to connect with yourself and do you want to be nourished and nurtured emotionally; mentally and spiritually? Now you can.  Most people I meet feel a deep need to connect more fully with themselves.  They find it difficult however because of their commitments.  They may find time to catch a yoga class or go to the gym however they still feel that they are rushing from one thing to the next. Learn to find peace and stillness in every day. My yoga teacher once told me that life is about relationships.  She was right. But the fundamental relationship we often don t focus on is our relationship to self.  When we spend time in spiritual practice on a daily basis; we nurture the soul; our creativity and ultimately our relationships with others.  We learn to experience a level of peace that is so fulfilling it profoundly changes our lives. The Love; Peace & Stillness Retreat includes... On each of the 10 days you download an MP3 file with a meditation. Each meditation is between 15-25 minutes long.  You will also have access to supporting information and details about the practice for that day.  At the end of the retreat; you keep the 10 meditations! The topics covered over the 10 days are as follows Day 1: Letting go Day 2: Balancing the chakras Day 3: Breath awareness Day 4: Embodied awareness Day 5: Connecting with the heart Day 6: Developing presence Day 7: Divine feminine Day 8: Divine masculine Day 9: Sacred marriage within Day 10: Cultivating joy and abundance On each day you will receive an intention to focus on for that day. The intention will help to keep you in the retreat zone. Here s what others say about the Love; Inner Peace & Stillness Meditation Retreat:  I hope you do this retreat again because I would really love to recommend it to people.  I would love to do more of this sort of work; so I hope you continue.  I loved that it was so easy to access and brought new awareness and joy to my life.  Great!  Thank you so much for your support throughout the ten days  LC Melbourne; Australia  What a beautiful way to start the morning! Thank you so much for creating this. It happened just at the moment when I started to waiver back into old mean habits.  GC Perth; Australia NB: Because meditation is a component of this retreat; and we are using visualization; if you have a mental health condition please check with your doctor to see if this is appropriate for you.  Teagan Fea does not accept any liability for injury caused by undertaking this retreat.</p>,Appropriate for all,?

Although we will study the basic electronic devices necessary for the construction of digital systems; our interest will focus more on the system than in the Electronics. This approach will allow us to establish the fundamentals of complex digital systems design. To follow the course it is necessary to have a basic knowledge of the base_2 arithmetics and the essential elements of Electricity/Electronics (components; currents; voltages; units; etc.). There will be a “week_0” in which students may perform some self-tests to check their level of knowledge on these subjects. This course is especially suitable for first years ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) engineering students; and also suitable for all those who wish to be initiated in the world of digital systems. This first course in digital systems is a must for all those who wish to deepen in the computer hardware and / or in the world of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs); which constitute an important part of robotics; bionics; industrial control and other application fields. After completing this course the student will be able to: Design digital systems of medium complexity. Describe and synthesize digital systems using high level hardware description languages. Understand the operation of computers at its most basic level (machine language). Collaborating teachers: Mercè Rullán Ayza Juan Antonio Martínez Joaquín Sáiz Alcaine David Bañeres Besora Vicenç Soler Ruiz Jordi Aguiló Llobet David Mateo Sobre el curso En este curso aprenderemos los fundamentos del diseño de los circuitos digitales actuales; siguiendo una orientación eminentemente práctica. Aunque estudiaremos los dispositivos electrónicos básicos necesarios para la construcción de los Sistemas Digitales;nuestro interés se centrará más en el sistema que en la Electrónica que lo sustenta. Este enfoque nos permitirá sentar las bases del diseño de Sistemas Digitales complejos. Para seguir el curso es necesario tener conocimientos previos del sistema de numeración binario; de programación (ningún lenguaje en concreto; sólo el concepto de pseudo-código); y de las bases de la Electricidad/Electrónica (componentes; corrientes; tensiones; unidades; etc.). Habrá una  semana_0  en la que los estudiantes podrán realizar pruebas de autoevaluación para comprobar su nivel de conocimientos en estos temas. Se trata de un curso muy adecuado para estudiantes de primeros cursos de carreras de Ingenierías cercanas a las TIC (Tecnologías de la Información y de las Comunicaciones); y para todas aquellas personas que deseen introducirse en el mundo de los Sistemas Digitales. Por otra parte; este primer curso de Sistemas Digitales es un paso obligado para aquellas personas que deseen posteriormente profundizar en temas como el hardware de computadores y/o los circuitos integrados de aplicación específica; con todas las aplicaciones que ello implica (robótica; biónica; control industrial; etc.). Al acabar el curso el estudiante será capaz de: Diseñar Sistemas Digitales de complejidad media. Describir y sintetizar Sistemas Digitales mediante lenguajes de descripción hardware de alto nivel. Comprender el funcionamiento de los computadores a su nivel más básico (lenguaje máquina); así como su materialización e interpretación a través de sistemas digitales algorítmicos.

But before you put a trade on; you need to perform Options analysis and simulation to understand how your position will behave under a diverse set of market conditions. Once you perform this Options analysis; you can immediately spot your weak points and you re prepared for them. Analysis and Simulation are as important as finding a good trade entry. In this course; we provide a complete roadmap to simulate every possible market condition BEFORE you put the trade on. This kind of analysis may take 30 minutes; but its well worth the time spent.   What you will master   How will your position behave for a + / - 5% move in your stock Options analysis before you put your trade on Options simulation to know where your profit zone is What is the impact of Time decay on your position What will Implied Volatility changes do to your position Simulating the effects of two variables on your position Simulating all three variables Stress testing your trade    ,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Options Foundation - Time Decay; Implied Volatility; Greeks; Udemy; online Business courses,N/A,Online Course - Options Foundation - Time Decay; Implied Volatility; Greeks,Udemy,$149,3 hours,Yes,Options trading mentor Hari Swaminathan,SECTION I - TIME DECAY Time decay is a pivotal component of Options strategies. In fact; time decay alone is responsible for the majority of advanced option strategies. In this part of the course; we are going to study the concept in detail. Options are  wasting  assets; and they lose value every day. The buyer gets hurt from time decay and the seller benefits from it. And time decay becomes more exponential as we approach expiry of an Option. It is also the great equalizer between the profiles of a buyer and seller of Options. Time decay is the great equalizer in the risk / reward profiles of buyers and sellers of Options. Several intermediate and advanced strategies are based on selling premium (option sellers) and these positions make a profit due to time decay in the value of these options over a period of time. What you will master What is time decay and how does it benefit Option sellers A complete recap of buyer and seller risk and reward profiles Why does the seller of Options not want movement in the Stock Why is Time decay the great equalizer between buyers and sellers of Options Apply the concept of time decay to our real world examples How can we observe Time deacy in Options in the financial markets Demonstration of time decay using AAPL Options SECTION II - IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND OPTION PRICES Implied Volatility is the  wildcard  in Option prices. Ignore it; and you will pay a price. In fact; it s so important we have at least four different varieties - Volatility; Implied Volatility; Historical Volatility; and Future or Expected Volatility. We use the real-world examples to explain the concept of Volatility in simple terms. Then we study how Volatility is quantified in Stocks and Options. And how Volatility finds a back-door to embed itself into Option prices. Implied Volatility considerations are critical when choosing between a buyer and seller profile. We break this complex topic down into simple terms and show you an example of NFLX and CAT options that should make it absolutely clear what this is all about. What you will master How are Option prices determined and is there an unknown variable Why is it difficult to calculate or determine Implied Volatility of an Option Why is this called  implied  Volatility How does Implied Volatility manifest itself into Option prices Why is it the  wildcard  in Option prices Understand a real world example of Volatility What is the relationship between Option prices and Implied Volatility How should buyers and sellers look at Implied Volatility Are some strategies better for high volatility situations How can we observe Implied Volatility in real Option prices SECTION III - OPTION GREEKS; DELTA; GAMMA; VEGA; THETA If you re the pilot of an aircraft; the Greeks are your instrument panel. If you don t manage your instrument panel properly; well...you get the picture. Understanding the Greeks are absolutely critical to every Option position. We break this course into easy to understand chapters for all the four Greeks - Delta; the king of all Greeks. Gamma - the silent operator. Theta - every Option seller s dream. And Vega - Watch out for this one.. Most beginners to Options tend to ignore the Greeks. Master the Greeks and you ll shave off months of learning curve. Not to mention; you can then fly your aircraft on  auto-pilot  (with help from the Greeks). What you will master The four Greeks that govern all movements in Option prices How each Greek individually impacts option prices Why Delta is the king of all Greeks What do we mean by directional risk How does each Greek affect a buyer and a seller of Options Why the Greeks are critical to understand your Option position How the Greeks impact choice of  moneyness  and expiry series SECTION IV - OPTIONS MARKET STRUCTURE; TERMINOLOGY; MARKET MAKERS AND MORE The Options market has a number of terms that we need to be aware of. Starting with terminology differences like  Long  and  Short ; we look at all the details that go into the Options market. We explain the important processes like Exercise and Assignment; as well as things like Expiry series; Bid-Ask spreads; Brokerage and transaction costs and various other details. What is Open Interest and why is it important; and what is the role of a Market Maker. We study the different Order types and which ones are important for the average investor; and which ones make sense in different situations. We also discuss Regulation T Margin as it applies to Options as well as Portfolio margin. What you will master What does Open Interest tell us about liquidity and what should we watch for What is Exercise and Assignment and how does it work What can Open Interest tell us about general sentiment about the stock What are the different Order types and which ones are the best What is the role of Market Makers on the Options exchange How is Regulation T margin calculated and what is Portfolio margin This is Course II of a 4-course step-by-step program to achieving Options mastery.  Course I - Introduction to Options - Learn about Call Options and Put Options is a detailed step-by-step explanation of Options; Call Options and Put Options with theory and practical application with Apple (AAPL) Options Course II - Options Foundation - Time Decay; Implied Volatility and Options Greeks will complete your theoretical understanding of Options.

We know time decay is exponential; but how do the Greeks actually behave during this time. This course on Trading Options at Expiration takes a deep dive using Apple (AAPL) Options Weekly series. All Weekly Option series open for trading on Thursday morning and trade until the following Friday. We follow an AAPL Short Straddle trade from Thursday morning until deep into the following week. The Short Straddle is explained in detail in this course; however; the reader may also view the Straddles and Strangles course; to get a more complete understanding of this type of trade. The Greeks are on steroids during the final week of an Option s life. Option Greeks behave abnormally during the final week; especially the At-The-Money Options. It should be intuitive that these Options are experiencing an enormous amount of uncertainty insofar as to whether they will end up in-the-money or not. What may not be clear is how the Greeks behave during this time which ultimately impacts Option prices. Most importantly; the lectures focus on the kinds of strategies that are ideal during the final two weeks before expiry. Although most strategies tend to focus on the most dominant Options characteristic during this time (Time Decay); the course also shows a couple of very interesting; very high reward strategies with very little risk.   What can you expect What are Weekly Options and why are they special What characteristics do Options have when they are very close to expiry What kind of trades are suitable during this time What sort of attention do you need to give to these trades What kinds of traders are Weekly Options suitable for What time decay strategies could work during the final week The impact of the final weekend on Option prices What challenges and pitfalls can you expect from Weekly Options What role does the Greek Gamma take on during this time And why does Vega whimper out during this time And what about Delta and Theta - it s a total Greek-fest  WEEKLY OPTIONS ARE VERY EXCITING TO TRADE BUT MAKE SURE THEY ARE FOR YOU !!!,Appropriate for all,?

This course is intended to help you become conversational in basic Spanish. To become truly proficient in a second language requires years of practice; but this course is designed to give you an engaging; intuitive way to start communicating. The course is designed around an imagined trip to a Spanish-speaking country. You begin at your destination airport; and are guided through various real-life scenarios that you would find yourself in if you were really in a Spanish-speaking country. These practical scenarios will be supplemented by clear and concise direct instruction in vocabulary and basic grammar. For those who are interested in more in-depth explanations of the grammar; there are supplementary videos linked throughout the course. Throughout the course; you will learn to talk about the following things in Spanish: • meeting people • what you need and want • making purchases • what you like and don t like • getting medical help • restaurants and hotel accommodations • travel and getting around The length of completion varies based on how long you need to spend on each unit; and how often you go back to review things that you previously covered. Learning a language is not a race; so don t be afraid to take your time or to go back and review as necessary. The course is designed to be self-directed; but the instructor will check messages at least weekly in order to answer questions or clarify concerns. The course presents scenarios that you would encounter as a traveler; but most of what you learn could easily be transferred to other situations. For instance; there are many scenes in which you are a customer of some sort; you could just as easily view these scenes from the point of view of the seller; doctor; etc.,Appropriate for all,?

This is a real shame as the content and nature of our thoughts fundamentally change the world around us. This Think Outside the Box course will both blow and open your mind and you will learn how to think outside the box. It uncovers both where the  flavours  come from and how we can use them in our daily lives to live more magically and happily. We tend to think that all our thoughts are in our heads and it is a common misunderstanding that our brains are the generators of thought. It is more accurate to describe the brain as both a receiver and transmitter of thought. The real clue as to where many thoughts come from can be found in our language. We say things like “Off the top of my head” and “I can feel it in my water”. These are not casual utterances but give us real clues as to the true nature and source of our thoughts. It’s also often misquoted that our thoughts become things … it is much more accurate to say that they are things! Furthermore; not all thoughts are may what you think of as your own. This think outside the box course is a philosophical exploration which lifts the lid on what it means to be human and the possible nature and sources of our thoughts. Changing our thoughts though is not simply about either having a glass half full or half empty mentality. The very nature our thoughts are richer; and tastier than we think. This think outside the box course exposes some secrets known only by sages; mystics and seers that have been hidden for thousands of years. BONUS AUDIO COMPILATIONS: If you want to listen to the lectures about the flavours on your MP3 player; tablet or smartphone; there are three bonusMP3 audio downloads. CAVEAT: This course contains references to the Tarot and was inspired by the hidden messages contained within it. It is not a course that teaches the Tarot; divination and fortune telling. If the very notion of the Tarot somehow conflicts with your creed or religion; then this course is not for you. If however you are curious about the human mind and the human condition; then there are untold treasures to be found in this magical glyph. This course deconstructs and contemporizes just some of the secrets buried in its imagery and structure.

To master the basics of Options; you really need all three courses. You can get this bundle for 15% discount at $399. A brief synopsis of the options trading strategies courses are provided blow; but for complete details please visit the individual course links below.   LEARN CALL OPTIONS AND PUT OPTIONS OPTIONS FOUNDATION - TIME DECAY; IMPLIED VOLATILITY; OPTION GREEKS BUYING CALL OPTIONS AND PUT OPTIONS - LIVE TRADES    SECTION I -  Call Options Most people learning Options for the first time face too much jargon and complex language. This options trading strategies course use real-world examples (buying a house) to explain how a Call Option (Section 1) works in real life. This example should make it absolutely clear what a Call Option is in step-by-step details. SECTION II - Put Options. The Put Option is the ultimate  protector  of your portfolio; and in this course you can learn how Put Options work. It is the exact opposite of a Call Option. Put Options increase in value when the value of a stock or index drops in price. We define what a Put Option; and just like we did in the Call Option; we consider a real-world example of a Put Option. SECTION III - Stock and Options combo strategies In this section; three creative strategies are outlined for Stock investors to combine Options into their portfolio strategies. ·  Use Options to buy Stock at prices that are far lower than what the stock is currently trading for ·  Use Options to sell Stock at prices that are far higher than what it is currently trading for ·  Use Options to hedge a Stock position that you already own  SECTION IV - TIME DECAY Time decay is a pivotal component of Options strategies. In fact; time decay alone is responsible for the majority of advanced option strategies. In this part of the options trading strategies course; we are going to study the concept in detail. Options are  wasting  assets; and they lose value every day. The buyer gets hurt from time decay and the seller benefits from it. And time decay becomes more exponential as we approach expiry of an Option. It is also the great equalizer between the profiles of a buyer and seller of Options. Time decay is the great equalizer in the risk / reward profiles of buyers and sellers of Options. Several intermediate and advanced strategies are based on selling premium (option sellers) and these positions make a profit due to time decay in the value of these options over a period of time.  SECTION V - IMPLIED VOLATILITY Implied Volatility is the  wildcard  in Option prices. Ignore it; and you will pay a price. In fact; it s so important we have at least four different varieties - Volatility; Implied Volatility; Historical Volatility; and Future or Expected Volatility. We use the real-world examples to explain the concept of Volatility in simple terms. Then we study how Volatility is quantified in Stocks and Options. And how Volatility finds a back-door to embed itself into Option prices. Implied Volatility considerations are critical when choosing between a buyer and seller profile. We break this complex topic down into simple terms and show you an example of NFLX and CAT options that should make it absolutely clear what this is all about. SECTION VI - OPTION GREEKS; DELTA; GAMMA; VEGA; THETA If you re the pilot of an aircraft; the Greeks are your instrument panel. If you don t manage your instrument panel properly; well...you get the picture. Understanding the Greeks are absolutely critical to every Option position. We break this course into easy to understand chapters for all the four Greeks - Delta; the king of all Greeks. Gamma - the silent operator. Theta - every Option seller s dream. And Vega - Watch out for this one.. Most beginners to Options tend to ignore the Greeks. Master the Greeks and you ll shave off months of learning curve. Not to mention; you can then fly your aircraft on  auto-pilot  (with help from the Greeks). SECTION VII - OPTIONS MARKET STRUCTURE The Options market has a number of terms that we need to be aware of. Starting with terminology differences like  Long  and  Short ; we look at all the details that go into the Options market. We explain the important processes like Exercise and Assignment; as well as things like Expiry series; Bid-Ask spreads; Brokerage and transaction costs and various other details. What is Open Interest and why is it important; and what is the role of a Market Maker. We study the different Order types and which ones are important for the average investor; and which ones make sense in different situations. We also discuss Regulation T Margin as it applies to Options as well as Portfolio margin. SECTION VIII - BUY A CALL OPTION (CHIPOTLE MEXICAN GRILL) Buying a Call Option is the most basic of all the Option strategies and is the most efficient strategy to optimize a bullish outlook on a stock. In this options trading strategies course; we take the example of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and show how the trade played out. We analyze the rationale behind entering the trade; the risk/reward profile; chart analysis and point of entry; choice of expiry and  moneyness  of the Option; time decay considerations; margin requirements; profit expectations; exit criteria; Greek analysis; its Profit and Loss profile and various other considerations. We provide a 360-degree analysis before trade entry. This is a real trade and over 15 days; and we navigate the trade to its exit point. SECTION IX - BUYING A PUT OPTION (FXE EURO ETF) Buying a Put Option serves two purposes - exploit a bearish move in the stock or be the ultimate protector of your stock. In this part of the course; we take the example of the Euro ETF (FXE) and show how the trade played out in about 25 days time. We analyze the rationale behind entering the trade; the risk/reward profile; chart analysis and point of entry; choice of expiry and  moneyness  of the Option; time decay considerations; margin requirements; profit expectations; exit criteria; Greek analysis; its Profit and Loss profile and various other considerations. We provide a 360-degree analysis before trade entry. We show you how to  let your winners run  in a controlled manner. SECTION X - STRATEGY AND OPTIMIZATION The Option strategy optimization course brings all the 4 Options strategies together. The 4 strategies are comprised of 2 bullish and 2 bearish strategies; but how and when should we choose a particular strategy over the other. We create a helpful  4 strategies box  to distinguish and connect one strategy to the other. Most importantly; what are all the considerations before we choose a strategy. Our choice of strategy depends not only on what the stock is currently doing; but also on various market externalities as well as a few key Option metrics like Implied Volatility. This course also provides a sneak peek into advanced Option topics like the VIX (Fear index ); trade simulation as well as trade adjustment parameters. SECTION XII - SINGLE OPTION ADJUSTMENTS This options trading strategies course studies the need for Option adjustments; and why adjustments are as critical to the success of your position as good entry or analysis. We consider all the four basic strategies - the Long Call; Short Call; Long Put; and the Short Put and look at various adjustments to these positions if they get into trouble. Every investor has a  pain point  - this is the point at which they adjust their position. Applying a rigorous approach to this pain point enables investors to control risk while maximizing the opportunity to profit. The course also discusses various details like early adjustments; over-adjusting and adjusting profitable trades as well as the importance of the investor s outlook for the stock when considering adjustments. This bundle consists of  Courses I through III of a 4-course step-by-step program to achieving Options mastery.  Course I - Introduction to Options - Learn about Call Options and Put Options is a detailed step-by-step explanation of Options; Call Options and Put Options with theory and practical application with Apple (AAPL) Options Course II - Options Foundation - Time Decay; Implied Volatility and Options Greeks will complete your theoretical understanding of Options.

They create passwords; follow security protocols; and share information that can maintain or destroy the security of a system. However; many secure systems are designed with little to no attention paid to people s cognitive abilities; workflow; or tasks. As a result; people find ways around the security obstacles that get in the way of their work. This course focuses on how to design and build secure systems with a human-centric focus. We will look at basic principles of human-computer interaction; including the basics of humans  cognitive abilities; principles of usability; design techniques; and evaluation methods. We will then apply these insights to the design of secure systems with the goal of developing security measures that respect human performance and their goals within a system. Through hands-on exercises designing; building; evaluating; and critiquing systems; students will learn how to integrate usability into secure software. The course will specifically focus on authentication mechanisms; browsing security; privacy and social media; and mobile security.,Appropriate for all,?

Intended Audience This course will offer a practical approach to prescribing antibiotic therapy and development of antimicrobial stewardship to physicians and pharmacists across all specialties and settings. Course Description Antibiotics are among the most frequently prescribed classes of drugs and it is estimated that approximately 50% of antibiotic use; in both the outpatient and inpatient settings; is inappropriate. At the same time; in contrast to any other class of drugs; every antibiotic use has a potential public health consequence – inappropriate use may not harm only the individual patient; but contributes to societal harm by exerting an unnecessary selective pressure that may lead to antibiotic resistance among bacteria. This course will offer a number of illustrative cases; recognizable to the practicing physician in his or her practice to engage the learners in the thought processes that lead to optimal decision making; improved outcomes of individual patients; and harm reduction vis-a-vis the bacterial ecology. Learning Objectives Develop skills to apply IDSA guidelines in treating common infections such as acute rhino-sinusitis. Apply evidence based antibiotic management to treat sepsis. Implement principles of antimicrobial stewardship when providing care to special populations and in various settings. Apply evidence based antibiotic management to surgical patients requiring antibiotic prophylaxis. Apply evidence based antibiotic stewardship program in the outpatient setting.Accreditation Statement The Stanford University School of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to provide continuing medical education for physicians.

If you or your relatives have problems with health; alcohol; or nicotine dependence; I’m ready to help you right now! My name is Emelianov Anatoly. I’m a parapsychologist and psychic. My extrasensory abilities were inherited from my grandfather and father. Every day many people come to me. Every day I receive patients. But unfortunately; I cannot consult everybody face-to-face. My aim is to use my abilities in the most productive way to help as many people as possible. That is the reason I’ve decided to make a video course that can help even those who cannot come to see me. The video has the same effectiveness as if one had visited me personally. I’ve been practicing my healing sessions since 1982. Since then; I’ve successfully treated more than 3;000 people. Traditional medicine cannot offer any drug that is able to treat you totally. It gives nothing but a temporary relief and negative consequences at the same time. Moreover; modern medicine will never want you to be healthy. The medical industry; as all the other industries; is aimed at constant and increasing profit. Do you think drug producers are interested in your treatment? Who will buy their products if you don’t? They would be bankrupt. This is obvious. - How do you treat yourself once and for all? - How do you regain health? - How do you make all your illnesses stop troubling you and start feeling really healthy? - How do you give up drinking and smoking? There is a very simple; effective; and proved solution. I’m talking about my unique healing sessions; which have no analogs in the world. People are so desperate; that they are ready to give away all their savings to regain health and to feel power and energy again. Scientists all over the world are trying their best to find a universal remedy for old age and illnesses. There’s no need to pay huge sums of money and no need to invent anything. Human nature is wise enough to treat itself. Yes; it’s true. Every organism can restore itself naturally. All you need is to open this ability in yourself. How? With the help of my healing video sessions! My system has nothing in common with any of the existing methods. I help to bring consciousness; subconsciousness; and biofield into compliance. My system doesn’t treat local problems; it treats the organism as a whole. It removes illnesses themselves – not just the symptoms. It is necessary to provide problematic organs with a flow of energy (this can be done only on the biofield level) and remove blocks from our consciousness and subconscious. When your consciousness is “awake;” this is difficult to do; your thoughts don’t let you do this. It is impossible to throw the illness off if you think about it every second. At the same time; it cannot be done in a state of deep sleep. One needs to be plunged into a specific state on the edge of sleep and wakefulness. This state is called meditation; prayer; or trance. All the religions use this state for a reason – it is a basis of many spiritual energetic practices. Even traditional medicine uses it in the form of hypnosis. In this wonderful state; the consciousness is sleeping and doesn’t create obstacles for healing powers. On the contrary; the subconscious starts working with double force. While watching my video sessions; this state is turning on; and a healing mechanism is being started stage by stage: -The energetic matrix is restored (wholeness of biofield). -The energetic system is restored (energy inflow). -Healing information comes inside (to consciousness and subconscious). -Illness disappears on an energetic level. The physical body duplicates the energetic one; and the illness disappears on the physical level as well! You recuperate totally – whether you want it or not! (Still; your desire to be healthy is necessary to prevent illness from coming back to your consciousness). It looks like a miracle; but it works! You just start the mechanism of organism self-healing. I should repeat - all illnesses will disappear: - Whether the diagnostics were made or not - Regardless if the illness has a physical or mental nature The story of every patient is unique. But the common link is that they all are healed with the help of my sessions! As a gift; this course includes two special sessions that can rescue you from alcohol and nicotine dependence! You won’t have to wrestle with yourself. No agony. No backslides. Everything is fine on the subconscious level once and for all. After a couple of sessions; you will feel that the desire for alcohol and cigarettes is waning; and it tastes disgusting to you. Feel full of life without alcohol and cigarettes and help those who need it! The present course is made to help you get rid of any diseases and stop drinking and smoking. The course consists of three video sessions: 1) Session 1: “Be Free of Diseases!” 2) Session 2: “Stop Drinking!” 3) Session 3: “Quit Smoking!” In order to make it more comfortable to watch; each video session is divided into two parts. In the beginning of each session I give necessary recommendations about the proper way of watching my sessions. If you want to feel the effectiveness of my sessions; you should watch them every day for one to two months. You will never find anything like this anywhere. These are truly unique healing sessions! I believe every man in the world is obliged to be healthy! Live without illnesses and bad habits!,Appropriate for all,?

Watch and listen as this play is explained in detail and the exact pattern to look for that would have tipped you off that the market was going to rally strong - what to look for; why the decline was over (this alone is worth the price of this training!) and the best way to profit from the inevitable rise in prices...

(I actually show you in real-time how this one greek can make you a killing)... Proven; practical techniques to use in any kind of market to make real and substantial profits with real case studies... How to KNOW ahead of time that the market is likely to have a big drop - what to buy and when to get out... How to KNOW when a market has stopped declining and is ready to advance strongly - what to buy and when to get out... Why buying CALLS at the bottom of a large decline in prices is the WORST thing you can do and why and what options to buy instead for massive profits as the market starts to rally... How to leverage options so you can profit as much as shorting or going long the actual stock at 1/10th the investment - exactly what to buy and when... The best way to profit when you know prices are going up (and it s not buying CALLS)... The best way to profit when prices are about to enter a new bear market (and it s not complicated)... Why the simplest trades are sometimes the best trades... The only thing you need to know to make money in the market (and it has nothing to do with technical analysis; indicators or whether the market is moving up or down)... Which option to choose - how and why - when going long or short the market...

Specifically; my stepmother and I now have a much better relationship after 20+ years of not getting along. My husband and I have taken our relationship to a new level of support and communication. The tools I ve applied have helped me to come from a place of inner strength and confidence without becoming defensive or taking things personally.  ~ Cheryl Coffey  The Life on Purpose Process has truly been life-changing. Not only did it help me to gain crystal clarity about my life purpose; it helped me to uncover what had been holding me back for much of my life. Through the Process; I became clear about what was the next step that I wanted to take in my life.  ~ Jonathan Dudley from Ireland The Life On Purpose Process is a proven; systematic; spiritually-based and practical approach that over the past seventeen years has assisted thousands of people to clarify their life purpose and to then further assist them to design their life as a true and authentic reflection of their purpose. To expand upon this just a bit: Proven — Since its conception in the mid-90’s; thousands of people have used the Life On Purpose Process to bring clarity of purpose to their life so we know it works and works well; Systematic — The 6 Passages that make up the Process will guide you step by step—truly a road map to your life on purpose. Spiritually Based — The Life On Purpose Process works with and is consistent with universal spiritual principles found in all authentic spiritual paths; like the law of attraction; the attractive force of universal Love; the power of gratitude and living a grace-filled life; etc. People of many different religions and denominations have experienced the process and received immense value including those whose definition of spiritual didn’t include a belief in a Higher Power necessarily. In the Life On Purpose Process spiritual is defined as a connection to a deeply held set of values and to a purpose beyond one’s self-interest. Practical — Not just theory or esoteric principles; but ideas; distinctions; and tools that you can apply immediately to enhance your experience of daily life.  I cannot end the year without expressing once again the impact the Life on Purpose Virtual Video Coach had in my life. This process was a defining moment for me and I can confidently declare that I am living each day expressing the best version of myself because I live on purpose.... and when the waters get choppy; I have the tools to sail through them.  Irma T Ruiz of Puerto Rico The six passages of the Life On Purpose Process include: 1. Preparing for the Journey Along the Purposeful Path: As with any challenging journey; it’s best to thoroughly prepare yourself for your travels along the Purposeful Path. This includes accurately determining where you are starting from and where you intend to end up; as well as what some of the obstacles that can get in the way of completing the journey. “Purposeful Preparation” is important to a successful journey. 2. Starting on the Correct Path with the Life On Purpose Perspective: As with any journey it makes sense to begin on the path that will get you where you want to go most expediently; so we’ll explore how most people have thought of a life purpose (the Cultural Perspective); and then look in depth at the Life On Purpose Perspective that open a door to a new world of purpose and possibility. 3. Clarifying What Has Been Shaping Your Life – Your Inherited Purpose: Another key passage along the Purposeful Path is clearly identifying what has been shaping your life and keeping you from clarifying and living your true; divinely inspired life purpose. We call this the Inherited Purpose – a powerful force based in fear; lack and a need to struggle to survive that shapes our lives much of the time; especially when we’re unclear about our true purpose. Many who have already traveled along the Purposeful Path feel that identifying their specific and unique Inherited Purpose to be one of the most powerful; transforming parts of the Process. 4. Clarifying & Polishing Your True; Divinely Inspired Purpose: After “cleaning the slate” by identifying and beginning to be responsible for your Inherited Purpose; the real fun begins as you go through a process called “Priming Your Passion” to clarify your true; divinely inspired life purpose. The process can be not only life affirming; but also life transforming. This completes Stage 1 or the clarifying your life purpose stage. 5. Learning the Tools for Living On Purpose: This is the start of Stage 2 of the Process in which you begin to live true to your life purpose. This is where the “rubber meets the road” and where some of the biggest transformations take place as you’re introduced to 15 Power Tools for Living On Purpose. You will use these tools to begin to build your life on purpose. 6. Mastering the Tools for Living On Purpose: Of course; being introduced to a set of tools is just the beginning; especially if you’re interested in building a masterpiece of a life on purpose. In the sixth passage you will learn how to master the art and science of creating a life that is shaped by your true; divinely inspired life purpose. “I had always felt like I was not living up to my potential and that there was something more to life- something more I “should be doing”. What I discovered was that what I thought my life purpose was actually my parents/culture’s idea of what I should be- not mine! This was transformational and allowed me to finally decide for myself; based on my own passions; my true purpose. My Divine Purpose is now conscious and drives all decisions and choices I make in my everyday life.”~ Julie Chapman in Greensboro NC Plus Added Bonuses Included in the Life On Purpose Course are these special bonuses designed to further enhance your life on purpose: Purposeful Planning: How to Be Sure that All Your Goals & Projects are Divinely Inspired One of the most powerful ways to bring more purpose and passion in your life is through Purpose Projects Purpose Project will escalate your ability to design your life on purpose. This special report will show you how to be sure how your Purpose Project are Divinely Inspired. The Power of Engagement Bonus Video & PDF Report We all have the gift of engagement — the ability to engage ourselves and others into the possibility of living on purpose; for example. Yet; for many of us; it’s not well differentiated and therefore we have only limited access to it. Designing Your Encore Performance Bonus Video #2 Have you bought into the ‘Golden Year Fantasy’ that says that once you reach sixty or sixty-five; you’re supposed to retire to some Sun City type retirement community where you and all the other ‘has beens’ spend countless hours playing tennis; golf or shuffle board; only to die quietly in your sleep a few years later? Well; that’s simply not the reality of today. Special Tuition for Udemy Students Hundreds of people have benefited from the Life On Purpose Process as an online program in the past paying as much as $219. For a limited time the Life On Purpose Course is available to Udemy student for the introductory special tuition of $149. I was already familiar with Brad’s work because I reviewed his book Life on Purpose: Six Passages to an Inspired Life in 2007; and we’ve kept in touch over the years. Life on Purpose is simply the best book on life purpose I’ve ever read; and it deserves the rare honor of maintaining a solid 5-star average rating on Amazon.com. I went through the entire program in May; and I loved it. I had to chuckle at the synchronicity because this was essentially the product I was trying to create. My ideas and processes were different of course; but the end benefits would be the same — to help you bring a clear sense of purpose to your life and to fully ground it in your daily actions; so that you’re truly living on purpose. ~ Personal development expert Steve Pavlina,Appropriate for all,?

Levi,This course will teach you how to hack your learning; reading; and memory skills; empowering you to learn anything and everything faster and more effectively. Whether you re a student; a professional; or simply embarking on a new hobby; you are forced to grapple with an every-increasing amount of information and knowledge. In fact; it s believed that one week s worth of the New York Times contains more information than people 100 years ago encountered in their entire lives. We ve all experienced the frustration of an ever-growing reading list; struggling to learn a new language; or forgetting things you learned in even your favorite subjects. Anyone can develop Super-Learning skills This course is about improving your ability to learn new skills or information quickly and effectively. We go far beyond the kinds of  speed-reading  (or glorified skimming) you may have been exposed to; diving into the actual cognitive and neurological factors that make learning easier and more successful. We also give you advanced memory techniques to grapple with the huge loads of information you ll be able to process. You ll learn how to input and retain information in a whole new way - a faster; better way The core of this SuperLearning course involves 3  super skills : Speed-reading with high (80%+) comprehension and understanding Memory techniques for storing and recalling vast amounts of information quickly and accurately Developing the cognitive infrastructure to support this flood of new information long-term However; the SuperLearning skills you ll learn in this course are applicable to many aspects of your every day life; from remembering phone numbers to acquiring new skills or even speaking new languages. How we ll teach you SuperLearning and advanced memory techniques The sad irony is that in order to learn most of these superlearning skills and memory techniques in the past; you had to read dozens of books and psychological journals. Or; you had to hire an expensive private tutor who specializes in superlearning. That s what I did. And it changed my life. Fortunately; my instructors (experts in the fields of superlearning; memory techniques; and speed-reading) have agreed to help me transform their materials into the first ever digital course. We ve designed a course based heavily on video-lectures and a great deal at-home exercises. The lecture components are only a small part of this superlearning course - you will be practicing various exercises and assignments on a regular basis. The course will require 2-3 hours of memory and speed-reading practice and training per week and training; and last roughly 4-6 weeks. It won t be easy - but if you put in the work; you are guaranteed to succeed. In addition to the lectures; there is an additional 1.5 hours of supplemental video content from TED; YouTube; and other sources which are considered part of the course curriculum.,Appropriate for all,?

Don t know if the clinic is worth it? Well; let me ask you this: How much is your health worth to you? Forget the money for a minute; what about the time and effort it takes to take care of yourself even when you just get a cold? Do you know that the illnesses and discomforts are reduced drastically by those who juice regularly. Do you know the hours and hours of time that you are going to save by NOT going to the doctor’s office; NOT going to the pharmacy to get cough medicine; NOT staying in bed because you will be getting healthier and stronger. Then think about the money; the healthcare cost of going to a doctor for a visit; buying medicine; and maybe involving others to take care of you at their expense. Now if skipping all of that pain and frustration and money lost – not to mention the euphoria you get from juicing – is not even worth $97 to you; then; you know what; the clinic may not be for you after all. The juicing clinic is for you if you want to invest in your health and stay AND feel young and healthy as long as possible. That’s PRICELESS to me and those in the clinic. What is it worth to you? You decide! Who is teaching the clinic? Hi; my name is Farnoosh. I left a long corporate job to start my own company so I can live the lifestyle of freedom; health; healing and a lot of juicing! You can find out more about me at Prolific Living.. Today; I have the immense pleasure of writing books on juicing and offering you an invitation to the Green Juicing Intensive Clinic. I had my first juice in 2007 and it changed my body (and my life!) The transformations to my body; mind and general happiness: remarkable; so I kept doing it. Five years later; I am still juicing regularly; fasting a few times a year; writing books and doing interviews about green juicing and spending time learning together with our great juicing community here. In January 2012; I wrote this little best-selling juicing book: Your Comprehensive Green Juicing Guide- to my surprise; it has already sold well over five thousand copies on Amazon – and you; my dear; get the entire guide FREE when you join the clinic. And in March 2013 my latest book; the Healthy Juicer’s Bible; came out in bookstores across the country. The book sold out of its first printing in less than a month. The clinic is where we put the book to practical application in life; so join us! Ready to get started? I will show you just about everything you need to know and make sure you have a grand time in your green juicing journey! Still not sure? I can only tell you that if you neglect your body; you will regret it. That’s all. Juicing has done miracles for me; for every single member in this juicing clinic and you are no different. Juicing will do miracles for you too. You decide what that’s worth to you. But no worry if you are not ready for the clinic. My only warning is that you’re gonna miss out on this amazing price and the LIFETIME MEMBERSHIP deal if you don’t join now. P.S. I know this is a tremendous step into for you to take; especially if you are brand new to green juicing. Don’t worry. You will be in good hands AND you will be part of a supportive loving community. Your body will LOVE you even if you juice a few times and just soak up the lessons and the love. Just in case you have reservations; I want you to know my husband; who used to swear he’d never drink a green juice for as long as he lives; is now begging me to make him a “Mean Green” in the mornings. Seriously; he’s a new person. Give juicing a serious go! You won’t regret it. This clinic is for the Juicing Enthusiast in You. I know it’s in there and I want to show you the same thing so you believe it too. See you in the clinic!,Appropriate for all,?

This is based on my book;  Strategic Economic Decision-Making: Using Bayesian Belief Networks to make Complex Decisions. This is a quick primer on the topic that introduces readers to the basic complexities and nuances associated with learning Bayes  theory and inverse probability for the first time. This brief is meant for non-statisticians who are unfamiliar with Bayes  theorem; walking them through the theoretical phases of set and sample set selection; the axioms of probability; probability theory as it pertains to Bayes  theorem; and posterior probabilities. All of these concepts are explained as they appear in the methodology of fitting a Bayes  model; and upon completion of the text readers will be able to mathematically determine posterior probabilities of multiple independent nodes across any system available for study. Very little has been published in the area of discrete Bayes  theory; and this brief will appeal to non-statisticians conducting research in the fields of engineering; computing; life sciences; and social sciences.,Appropriate for all,?

Duration: 10 weeks.  Click to learn more and find similar courses.,High Performance Scientific Computing; Coursera; online Technology courses,N/A,Online Course - High Performance Scientific Computing,Coursera,Free,10 weeks,Yes,Randall J. LeVeque,Computation and simulation are increasingly important in all aspects of science and engineering. At the same time writing efficient computer programs to take full advantage of current computers is becoming increasingly difficult. Even laptops now have 4 or more processors; but using them all to solve a single problem faster often requires rethinking the algorithm to introduce parallelism; and then programming in a language that can express this parallelism.  Writing efficient programs also requires some knowledge of machine arithmetic; computer architecture; and memory hierarchies. Although parallel computing will be covered; this is not a class on the most advanced techniques for using supercomputers; which these days have tens of thousands of processors and cost millions of dollars. Instead; the goal is to teach tools that you can use immediately on your own laptop; desktop; or a small cluster. Cloud computing will also be discussed; and students who don t have a multiprocessor computer of their own will still be able to do projects using Amazon Web Services at very low cost. Along the way there will also be discussion of software engineering tools such as debuggers; unit testing; Makefiles; and the use of version control systems. After all; your time is more valuable than computer time; and a program that runs fast is totally useless if it produces the wrong results. High performance programming is also an important aspect of high performance scientific computing; and so another main theme of the course is the use of basic tools and techniques to improve your efficiency as a computational scientist.,Appropriate for all,?

Thanks to spatial computing; a hiker in Yellowstone and a taxi driver in Manhattan can know precisely where they are; discover nearby points of interest and learn how to reach their destinations. Spatial computing technology is what powers the Foursquare check-in; the maps app on your smartphone; the devices used by scientists to track endangered species; the routing directions that help you get from point A to point B; the precision agriculture technology that is revolutionizing farming; and the augmented reality devices like Google Glass that may soon mediate our interaction with the real world. This course introduces the fundamental ideas underlying spatial computing services; systems; and sciences. Topics covered will include the nature of geospatial information; proper statistical frameworks for working with geospatial data; key algorithms and data structures; spatial data mining; and cartography/geovisualization. We will also address applied topics such as where to find spatial data; how to use powerful open source software to analyze and map spatial data; and frameworks for building location-based services. Three Ways to Enjoy this Course: This course is designed to support three different types of students and educational goals: Curiosity Track: Most of us interact with spatial technologies every day. This track is for students who wish to learn about one or two spatial computing topics; but not commit to an entire course. Curiosity track students are not interested in a certificate of accomplishment. Concepts Track: This track is for students who want to learn about spatial computing concepts in order to make informed choices; but who are not programmers and do not have extensive experience with statistical methods. For example; concepts track students will learn about Tobler’s First Law of geography and map projections; but will not delve into the quantifications of either. Students who complete the concepts track with sufficiently high scores will receive a Statement of Accomplishment. Technical Track: This track builds on the concepts track; but adds math and programming. For example; we will cover spatial statistical indicators like Moran’s I and Ripley’s K when discussing Tobler’s First Law and will have students calculate the distance between two points using two different coordinate systems and open-source APIs. Students who complete the technical track with sufficiently high scores will receive a Distinguished Statement of Accomplishment.,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Hardware Security; Coursera; online Math and Science courses,N/A,Online Course - Hardware Security,Coursera,Free,8 weeks,Yes,N/A,Hardware is the root of computation and communication. It is the enabler of any software; algorithm; or communication protocols. All the computation will eventually be carried out by hardware; namely the processor or the circuits. In this course; we will study security and trust from the hardware perspective. We will start with a short survey of the roles of hardware in security and trust. With all types of dedicated hardware/circuits; known as co-processors; being developed to speed up application specific computations; hardware’s role changes from the enabler to an enhancer. Nowadays; hardware becomes the enforcer for secure systems because it is used to ensure that only the authenticated user and software can access the processor. However; current hardware design flow does not have security as a key design objective. Consequently; we will conduct several case studies where hardware turns into the weakest link in secure systems. Then we will review the fundamentals of digital logic design and use this as an example to analyze the source of security vulnerabilities and demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can become legitimate security threats. We conclude with the basic principles and practical methods of design for security and trust; as well as a study of the associated design cost.   Next; we introduce physical attacks to popular digital systems such as smart cards and FPGA-based systems. We will focus on side-channel attacks; which have been demonstrated many times to be able to successfully reveal the secret cryptographic keys stored in the secure systems. These attacks include power analysis; timing attacks; and electromagnetic attacks. Standard countermeasures to these attacks will also be introduced. Finally we will learn the new hardware security primitives that can help us to build secure systems. We will see how the trust platform module (TPM) works; what is a silicon physical unclonable function (PUF) and why it is useful for system security; what is a hardware Trojan horse and the security threats it brings to the system; why counterfeiting becomes a serious problem for hardware design intellectual property protection. Upon completing the course; students will understand the vulnerabilities in current digital system design flow and the physical attacks to these systems. They will learn that security starts from hardware design and be familiar with the tools and skills to build secure and trusted hardware.,Appropriate for all,?

It aims to frame global health s collection of problems and actions within a particular biosocial perspective. It develops a toolkit of analytical approaches and uses them to examine historical and contemporary global health initiatives with careful attention to a critical sociology of knowledge. The teaching team; four physician-anthropologists; draws on experiences working in Asia; Africa; Eastern Europe; and the Americas; to investigate what the field of global health may include; how global health problems are defined and constructed; and how global health interventions play out in expected and unexpected ways. The course seeks to inspire and teach the following principles: A global awareness. This course aims to enable students to recognize the role of distinctive traditions; governments; and histories in shaping health and wellbeing. In addition; rather than framing a faceless mass of poor populations as the subject of global health initiatives; the course uses ethnographies and case studies to situate global health problems in relation to the lives of individuals; families; and communities. A grounding in social and historical analysis. The course demonstrates the value of social theory and historical analysis in understanding health and illness at individual and societal levels. An ethical engagement. Throughout the course; students will be asked to critically evaluate the ethical frameworks that have underpinned historical and contemporary engagement in global health. Students will be pushed to consider the moral questions of inequality and suffering as well as to critically evaluate various ethical frameworks that motivate and structure attempts to redress these inequities A sense of inspiration and possibility. While the overwhelming challenges of global health could; all too easily; engender cynicism; passivity; and helplessness; students learn that no matter how complex the field of global health and no matter how steep the challenges; it is possible to design; implement; and foster programs and policies that make enormous positive change in the lives of the world’s poorest and suffering people.,Appropriate for all,?

McFarland,It is hard to imagine living in modern society without participating in or interacting with organizations. The ubiquity and variability of organizations means there is ample room for complexity and confusion in the organizational challenges we regularly face. Through this course; students will consider cases describing various organizational struggles: school systems and politicians attempting to implement education reforms; government administrators dealing with an international crisis; technology firms trying to create a company ethos that sustains worker commitment; and even two universities trying to gain international standing by performing a merger. Each case is full of details and complexity. So how do we make sense of organizations and the challenges they face; let alone develop means of managing them in desired directions? While every detail can matter; some matter more than others. This is why we rely on organizational theories -- to focus our attention and draw out relevant features in a sensible way. Through this course you will come to see that there is nothing more practical than a good theory. Every week; you’ll learn a different organizational theory; and it will become a lens through which you can interpret concrete organizational situations. Armed with a toolset of theories; you will then be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it – and use the theories to predict which actions will best redirect the organization in a desired direction.

More recently; its scope has expanded to include things as diverse as data integrity; secure internet-wide communication; electronic cash; secure distributed computation; and more. Cryptography has also become ubiquitous. Perhaps unknowingly; we have all encountered applications of cryptography in our daily lives---whether by logging in using a password; making a web purchase over a secure connection; or applying a software update that is digitally signed.This course will introduce you to the foundations of modern cryptography; with an eye toward practical applications. We will learn the importance of carefully defining security; of relying on a set of well-studied “hardness assumptions” (e.g.; the hardness of factoring large numbers); and of the possibility of proving security of complicated constructions based on low-level primitives. We will not only cover these ideas in theory; but will also explore their real-world impact. You will learn about cryptographic primitives in wide use today; and see how these can be combined to develop modern protocols for secure communication.,Appropriate for all,?

Software is increasingly the vehicle that drives our economy and our personal lives. But software’s pervasiveness; and its importance; make it a target: at the root of many security compromises is vulnerable software. In this course we will look at how to build software that is secure. We will see that security must appear at all phases in the development lifecycle; including requirements development; system design; implementation; testing/validation; and maintenance. To start; we will consider tasks and methods that enhance a software system s design; including threat modeling and attack surface reduction. Then we will examine the most prevalent software implementation flaws. At the root of many of these flaws is a failure to mute the influence of untrusted information; and a failure to restrict the flow of private information. We will examine flaws like buffer overruns and double-free s that are present in programs written in low-level programming languages like C and C++. We will also examine flaws; like data races and improper randomness; that can arise in software written any language. Finally; we will look at flaws like SQL injection and cross-site scripting that are notable for their presence in web and mobile applications. Having examined these flaws and their role in security compromises; we will look at steps you can take to fix them; both at the design and the implementation level. Finally; we will look at state-of-the-art tools and techniques for testing and otherwise verifying that software is secure. We will consider how security testing differs from functional testing (it s harder!). We will look at the art of penetration testing; which is the activity of trying to find and exploit weaknesses in a system prior to its deployment. We will also look at an emerging class of program analysis tools that can automatically identify flaws in programs; either by analyzing their code or by monitoring their execution. At the conclusion of the course; the student will know how to  build security in  rather than consider it as an afterthought; and will have a plethora of skills; applicable at each phase of the development cycle; that can be used to strengthen the security of software systems.,Appropriate for all,?

This attitude would condition the architectural principles of the early Renaissance and architects did not apply themselves to textual imitations of individual antique monuments. In Florence; they preferred to accept and articulate the rational “system” of Brunelleschi; either transforming it; like Alberti; or breaking with it in a return to tradition; like Michelozzo. In north and south Italy; the battle between innovation and resistance was increasing in strength and substance because it not only encompassed immediate questions of decorative language  (antique forms and architectural orders) but also the problems of conceiving and constructing an architecture that could replace the gothic structural membering with the continuous masonry of the Antiquity. At first; the new decoration was frequently adapted to the existing architectural system; and only later did it find a partner in the different spatial and structural conceptions that descended from Florentine exempla. The tendency to see norms and models in antique architecture; which must be rigidly replicated; first affirmed itself at the beginning of the XVI century in Rome. Through some of the most celebrated examples of the early Renaissance architecture and the most important statements of the early Renaissance theories; the course will examine problems of the architectural spaces; technology and forms in the XV century in Italy; from Leon Battista Alberti’s to Francesco di Giorgio’s and Bramante’s proposals.,Appropriate for all,?

I want to introduce you to my mosaic technique which is all about cooking with style; imagination; and without time consuming measurements. The mosaic technique helps to create dishes that look like they come from a ritzy restaurant; but don’t break the bank. Most of my recipes are cost effective and all of them are flavorful. Overall; these recipes are healthy and have low fat content. In most non-baking recipes you can see that exact measurements do not make a big difference in the flavor of the dish; so we will focus more on flavor synthesis. The Mosaic technique will help make cooking effortless in respect to preparation time and effort. After all; cooking is the art of combining different flavors to come up with something exciting and new. By taking this course you will gain the experience that is needed to first reproduce the recipes (with or without measuring) and then create your own dishes based on variation and experimentation. Included is a list of ingredient substitutions; these will help you create even more recipe variants! I have also included comprehensive information on different herbs and spices that complement poultry; seafood; meats; and vegetables. Imagine being able to satisfy your family every night with a recipe that you created yourself. This is the way my mother and grandmother cooked; and it truly makes cooking enjoyable. *You do need to be specific with ingredients in baking as well as pay attention to the amount of strong flavored ingredients like garlic; herbs; spices or vinegar etc. in every dish. Disclaimer: the risks of cooking are inherent. Cook all meats; poultry and seafood to recommended temperatures for safety. Stoves and oven are hot…; knives are sharp; use at your own risk.,Appropriate for all,?

What was happening in music during the period in which Michelangelo was painting the Sistine Chapel? A return to some Ancient ideals led to a rediscovery of the science of acoustics; providing a basis for the theory of modern harmony. How the course of music changed as a result of Martin Luther’s break from the Church. • The Baroque. Here we have the origins of opera; as well as a flowering of instrumental music; culminating in the works of Bach; Handel and Vivaldi. • The Classical. In reaction to the florid complexities of the Baroque; and influenced by the Age of Reason; the Classical period focused on simplicity and elegance; producing such composers as Haydn; Mozart and Beethoven. • Romanticism. The Age of Reason was too “reasonable” for the the Romanticists. They valued heightened emotion over elegance. The music of Schumann; Chopin; Wagner; Tchaikovsky; Verdi and Puccini were some of its greatest accomplishments. • The Modern Period. Formerly referred to as the 20th century period; it now needs to reflect its expansion into the 21st century. Some of the greatest composers of this period have been Stravinsky; Bartok; Schoenberg; Britten; Shostakovich; Ives; Copland and Barber. • We conclude with a retrospective and some final remarks to wrap it all up. Testimonials from former students. I concurrently teach this course at Santa Rosa Junior College (for core Humanities credit). Please take a moment to read a few testimonials by Santa Rosa students about this course; as they testify to my passion and command of the subject matter. “As we get close the end of the semester; and I review my gigantic stack of notes; and think about everything I know now that I didn t know when we started; I wanted to thank you; Bill Neely; for sharing your knowledge with us. This has been a super-duper class; and I find myself a little sad to find it drawing to a close. I ve always enjoyed classical music rather passively; I now feel that I can be an active participant; with a deeper understanding of the musical concepts; the composers themselves; and their historical context. Very cool!” —Sandra L “My love for classical music has grown as I understand more now the times and styles and detours of styles these great composers took. I have found these lectures easy to understand and digest into my appreciation and education of classical music.” —Kathy J “I wanted to thank you for this wonderful class. I have a doctorate degree; and this has been one of the most thorough and informative classed I have ever taken. It has deepened my understanding and enjoyment of the music I have been listening to for the past 35 years. It has also allowed me to have intelligent conversations with my son who is an accomplished trumpet player; currently in the Brown University Orchestra ...I wanted to let you know how much I appreciate the depth and clarity of presentation of this class. Do you offer any other online classes? I have recommended it to many of my friends…” —Loretta Z “I really like your lectures; very informative; interesting and filled with a lot of information… This is what I hoped for in an online course. Great lectures; this is the first online class I ve taken that I felt the instructor was as dedicated to his online students as his in-person ones. Thank you!” —Stephanie M “...lectures were terrific; especially the use of the history of Rock  n  Roll to begin a very clear and concise exploration of the basics of music ...Thanks very much for teaching such an excellent course.

There s enough stuff out there in the development world to keep us both excited and overwhelmed. Learning new tech has become easier with the all the information available to us; especially in the way of these Pluralsight courses. But learning how to use a technology and learning how to properly implement it or integrate it with other technologies can be a whole different ballgame. Service-Oriented systems have become mainstream; but designing applications in a service-oriented fashion requires a different look on the components that make it up as well as technologies to support the architecture. This course will bring it all together for you by building on knowledge you have on technologies like WCF; Web API; ASP.NET MVC; WPF; and Knockout and going from A to Z on the architecture; design; development; and testing of a complete system. And this system will not only use a multitude of technologies in the middle-tier; but will also be consumed by different UI clients on the web and the desktop. Know how to write services in WCF and Web API; but want to see some real-world implementation from both MVC and WPF clients? This course is for you. Want to know how to implement dependency injection from the middle tier to the various UIs? This course is for you. Want to write decoupled; testable software? This course is for you. The final set of applications can be used as a skeleton and framework for any SOA-based system you write going forward; and the techniques used in its development will become part of your development arsenal forever.,Intermediate,?

Analyze; play and Improvise the most famous dramatic Tosca aria  And The Stars Were Shining  (E Lucevan le Stelle) of the great Opera Composer Giacomo Puccini. Learn scales; chords and notations; progressions and their emotional repercussions; music structure and improvising techniques; all in one. Derive your own music from classical musical material. Always have great musicians taken the music of other composers to invent new music: Think for example of Chick Corea and how he made out of Rodrigo  s  Concierto de Aranjuez  his own phantastic derivative work  Spain”. This example defines exactly the concept of this course: It shows you step by step the whole compositional process from the harmonic analysis of Puccini´s dramatic aria “And the Stars were Shining” through to your own personal improvised interpretation. The analysis of the aria´s chord progression verifies that the parts of high emotional arousal are those with a constant violation of expectancy of chord progressions. This is congruent with many scientific studies which have shown that unexpected chord progressions induce strong emotions. To meet the needs also of the advanced beginner there are introductory videos about the concepts of scales and chord-construction. This course is designed especially for the enthusiast of classical and modern music who wants to improve his harmony knowledge and who wants to learn compositional and improvisational techniques.,Appropriate for all,?
