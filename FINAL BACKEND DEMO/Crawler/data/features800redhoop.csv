Price: $75. Duration: 5 hours.  Click to learn more and find similar courses.,HOW to Focus For Golf - Discover the Psychology of Aiming; Udemy; online Sports courses,N/A,Online Course - HOW to Focus For Golf - Discover the Psychology of Aiming,Udemy,$75,5 hours,Yes,Mr Colin Cromack,Golf is a challenging mind game but an excellent vehicle for the development of valuable life skills. This unique golf coaching program is essential for anyone who attempts to play the game. If you ve ever asked your self  Why can t I do that ALL the time?  herein lie the answers to your many years of confusion. The purpose of this course is to help you understand HOW to focus your attention when developing technical skills; practicing on the range and competing out on the golf course. Your ability to learn how to focus your attention consistently when hitting golf balls IS NOT predicated by your technical skills but your ability to play your best golf IS limited by your ability to FOCUS consistently. You may not have the world s best swing but nothing can stop you from developing a world class focus. Existing golf coaching practices worldwide do not SYSTEMATICALLY explain or train the golfers Attention when learning; practicing and playing. This course closes that education gap. NO tips. NO quick fixes. Mastery of ALL life skills occurs when you make a critical shift in the focus of your attention - from what is an internal focus to an external focus. This shift usually happens naturally and NON-CONSCIOUSLY. You master riding a bicycle when you STOP focusing on your physical actions. You drive a car when you STOP focusing on your physical actions. You play a musical instrument when you STOP focusing on your physical actions. You master touch typing when you STOP focusing on your physical actions. Et cetera. The shift of Attentional Focus is vital. Playing golf demands the same shift. You may notice you do not play great golf whilst thinking about your swing/stroke but how can you play without swing thoughts if you only practice with them? HOW can you SHIFT your Attentional Focus away from your technique and experience FLOW in practice and play? You must change the way you practice. This course will explain HOW to TRAIN and TRUST your technical skills. If you could look at your TARGET whilst executing a golf shot few would argue that it should be the sole focus of your attention. Looking away from the target in order to execute your swing or putt does NOT make the target any less significant but therein lies the reason why golf is such a psychological challenge. Do you appreciate the difference between LOOKING at and SEEING your Target? Learning HOW to keep your ATTENTION locked on target (enabling an external focus); whilst looking down at the ball; is the unique challenge of the game of golf. Your target focus is often lost due to erroneous thoughts about your swing; the ball or un/desirable outcomes in the SECONDS prior to or during execution. Your attention is frequently OFF target and inconsistent outcomes are often the result. This course reveals why learning how to swing golf clubs efficiently and learning how to play golf are very different psychological skills; both of which need to be deliberately practiced. The key attributes of successful golfers explained within this golf training program include: State Management Concentration Attentional Focus Targeting Visualization Acceptance This course content will take approximately 5 hours. Once completed; contact Colin for your complementary 1 hour 1 to 1 remote coaching session via video conference which will help you develop a SINGLE pre-shot MENTAL procedure (not just a physical routine!) for use with EVERY golf club from the first tee to the last green. This will significantly simplify your golf game. You can NEVER master the game of golf but you can aspire to PLAY it. Take this unique golf training course now and learn to AIM accurately and consistently.,Appropriate for all,?

Well; that is because just like everything else in programming; you need to understand the architecture; the underground of whatever seems to be an easy task. Only then can you design solutions as opposed to only coding them. WCF transactions are built from ground up around .NET transactions.

NOW includes a Special Bonus; the Soul Star Meditation! Sensing — Increasing awareness of your own energy body (aura) and subtle energy in other people and the environment Cleaning —Removing dense or negative energy from your auric field Protecting — Shielding your energy field from negative energy This training was videoed in a professional studio with a classroom setup; and is based on the very popular  Energy Hygiene for Empaths  classroom training program. Because working with subtle energy is invisible it is easy for people to have doubts; so we build-in evidence procedures for each of the techniques that we teach. Are You an Empath? Empaths are people who are sensitive to other people and their environment. There are many different kinds of empathic sensitivity. Some empaths feel other people’s emotions; some feel others’ physical sensations; and some empaths are sensitive to what is happening to animals and even the natural environment. The kind of empath this training addresses is called an Energy Empath. These empaths may experience any or all of the other types of empathic sensing; and in addition; they are sensitive to and often absorb subtle energy from the environment and people around them. This is often heavy or negative energy; and it leaves the Energy Empath feeling many different kinds of negative symptoms; including confusion; emotional upset; nausea; itching/burning/swelling of the skin; and even asthma-like symptoms. If you want to find out if you are an Energy Empath; complete the free assessment included in Section 1 of the training (PDF version) or online at: Energy Empath Self-Assessment Fortunately; Energy Empaths do not have to continue to suffer. This video is designed to provide you with the understanding; tools; and techniques to easily and quickly sense; clean and protect your energy body. The advantage of the ISEE Energy techniques is that you can do them by yourself; anytime and anywhere! They involve mental visualization so you don’t need any special tools or privacy to use them like you would with smudging or sprays. So; whether you are in a business meeting; at a restaurant; in the mall; on a crowded airplane; at the family reunion; or driving the kid’s car pool; you can keep your energy clean; clear and protected!” Sections 1. Introduction 2. Understanding Energy Empathy 3. How to Sense Subtle Energy 4. Cleaning Your Energy Field 5. Protecting Your Energy Field 6. Conclusion 7.

I have been using Photoshop since version 3 and every time it gets better and better. I have created litterally thousands of designs and over that time I have found that there are number of key skills and tools us web designers use in almost every design. This is why I created; along with the team at Web Courses; a series of screencast tutorials ideal for beginner web designers who wants to Learn Web Design with Photoshop. 1. The Power of File and New In this lesson; you will learn how to open a new document and apply the settings you need to set up before you start designing in Photoshop. 2. Changing; Using and Installing Brushes A look at paintbrushes. The different types of brushes that you can use as well as installing some new brushes; so you can do some really nice affects on your design. 3. The Key to Custom Shapes Shapes is something we use a lot when we re designing a web page. It s used to make the layout and lots of other elements on the screen. We get used to this really useful tool in this lesson. 4. The Core of Photoshop; Layers and Groups Layers are the most important part of Photoshop; as they allow you to make changes to specific areas on the screen. You can further group these layers together to make it more manageable when you re designing. 5. The Shortcuts to Moving and Resizing In this lesson we re going to be looking at how to move layers around the screen and how to resize them using the free transform tool; something you will use a lot in your designs. 6. Getting the Most from Zooming and Panning We are going to look at how to look around your design and see the details by using the zoom tool. So in this lesson we look into two very important features of using Photoshop daily; zooming and panning. 7. Creating Cool Effects with Blending Modes Blending modes are when you have two layers interacting with each other and effects are different things you can apply to single layer; things like shadows; inners shadows; gradients etc. 8. Text; Love it or Hate it Texts are one of the trickiest things in Photoshop; reason being that its not really made to do it. So in this lesson; we re going to find easy ways to work with Photoshop and texts. 9. Clean Web Page Design using Photoshop We are going to be creating a webpage design in Photoshop.

By this definition our Earth is very much alive; with many eruptions each year and with a far greater number of “active volcanoes” that can potentially erupt in any given year.  In detail; each eruption is different. Every volcano is its own physical and chemical system; occurs in its own geological location; is subjected to its local stress field; and is at its own stage in evolution in geological time.  External triggers of volcanic eruptions are also believed to play an important role. Yet powerful generalisations and models of volcanic eruptions are indeed possible and in fact very useful in dealing with the consequences of volcanic eruptions. How are such models constructed? They must rest on a basis of a mechanistic understanding of what volcanoes are; and what they are doing – not just during eruptions but also in the events leading up to eruptions; and not just at the Earth´s surface but also at depth; where the magma is being prepared for the next eruption. In addition to field observations of past eruptions; monitoring of signals from magmatic systems; and computer-based simulation of volcanic eruptions; increasingly; high pressure and high temperature experiments are employed in order to answer the question of how volcanic systems work. These controlled laboratory conditions for experimental volcanology are transforming the study of volcanoes from a chiefly observational discipline where eruptive mechanisms were developed via theoretical analysis of such observations; into a fully modern scientific discipline where such theoretical approaches are either verified or rejected; by the experimental picture of what is possible and what is not. This course shows you how such experimental insight is obtained and what it tells us about erupting volcanoes.,Appropriate for all,?
