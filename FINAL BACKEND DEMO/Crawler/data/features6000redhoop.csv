On the other hand; this course is priced as a book might be - there s certainly more words; counting bonus material; than in the average book. If I priced it as a typical Udemy course and used their marketing; it would be about $150. So you re already getting more than 67% off . . .] This course is designed for people who want to design games - video or tabletop - but lack information about what is really involved and how to go about it. It s not rocket science; but commercial design is a JOB - one that cannot be done by rote; there is no  Easy Button . I m not here to encourage you; or entice you to read; I m here to inform you. I assume you have the motivation to learn how to design games; you just need to know how. And that means you need to do it from start to finish; to complete games rather than merely start them. We ll discuss the process of game design; the possible structures in games; the best way to start learning game design; what makes a game good (there s a great variety of opinion about this); ways to provide a framework for your design efforts; ways to keep records of your work; software to help you learn. Many aspiring game designers have crippling misconceptions (such as the notion that it s all about a great idea; or that everyone who counts likes the same games they do); and I ll try to clear those out of your way. This is not a comprehensive class about game design as a whole; it is a class about learning game design. That s a process that goes on throughout a game designer s career; but it starts here. This class will never be offered for free or at very deep discounts. That is disrespectful to me and to the students who pay full price or near it.

Scott Mayton Good Course The lecturer is very knowledgeable and has a lot of experience so knows exactly what he is talking about.

Shane Robinson awesome excellent Mauricio  As a novice video game maker of three years now; I have seen many people online talk about an  awesome  idea but never begin to make it. Dr. Pulsipher discusses some of the common pitfalls when designing a game; the steps it takes to actually make a playable game; and some of the less-than-glamorous realities of the game industry. I will definitely use what I have learned when designing my next game and I highly recommend it.

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Effective Classroom Interactions: Supporting Young Children’s Development; Coursera; online Education courses,N/A,Online Course - Effective Classroom Interactions: Supporting Young Children’s Development,Coursera,Free,4 weeks,Yes,N/A,When we look at the research about what teachers actually do each day that makes a difference in children’s lives; there’s clear evidence that it’s the daily interactions that teachers have with children that are most important.  And we know quite a bit about the specific type of interactions that lead to children’s development and learning.  So this course focuses on those interactions.  By the end of the course; you should have a deep knowledge and understanding of the types of interactions that foster learning and development among your students. Although there are many types of interactions that are critical to young children’s development; this course will focus on one area in particular – Emotional Support. This course focuses on Emotional Support because it is really the foundation of every early childhood classroom. In classrooms that are Emotionally Supportive children and adults are comfortable with one another and excited about learning. They look forward to spending time together and know that; even when times are tough; there will be someone there to help them. What do you need to know to be a really effective early childhood teacher? Teachers need many types of knowledge – knowledge about children’s development; about the content they’re teaching; about effective teaching practices; about the needs and abilities of the children in their classrooms; and about themselves. In this course we’ll focus a bit on knowledge about children’s development and we’ll spend lots of time focused on knowledge about specific types of classroom interactions that promote learning and development. Another part of effective teaching is seeing. All the knowledge in the world about effective teaching is only a piece of the puzzle. Good teachers need to see what effective teaching looks like – in lots of different types of classrooms; with lots of different types of children. Teachers tell us they don’t get nearly enough opportunities to see other teachers teach and they report how helpful these experiences are when they do get them. We’ll spend lots of time in this course focused on observing classroom videos and we’ll also ask you to spend some time watching yourself teach. Ultimately we can’t learn to be an effective teacher without practice – we need to spend some time doing – enacting the teaching practices that we’ll learn about. Just as young children need to do things to really learn about them – you need to spend some time practicing the types of interactions we’ll be talking about. There’s one last important element to being an effective teacher. Effective  teachers spend time reflecting on their practice. We think of this a bit like taking time to really look at your teaching through a magnifying glass – we’ll give you time to reflect on your teaching and what you have learned throughout this course. Much of this course is based on the research of Drs. Robert Pianta; Bridget Hamre and many colleagues UVA and other institutions using the Classroom Assessment Scoring System – or CLASS(™). CLASS is an observational measure used in research and practice that defines specific elements of effective teaching. In this course you will see examples of the kinds of teaching practices assessed by the CLASS. And you will get opportunities to observe and analyze your own teaching practice in ways that have been shown to increase the effectiveness of teachers  interactions with young children.   ********************************************************************* The development of the course was funded; in part; by the Institute of Education Sciences; U.S. Department of Education; through Grant R305A100154-11 to the University of Virginia.  The opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not represent views of the U.S. Department of Education. ,Appropriate for all,?

In recent years; however; it has become apparent that teaching is not an intuitive behavior. In addition to content; teaching also involves a complex intellectual process; and to develop the “art” of teaching; professors require guidance and support. As the roles and responsibilities of university-level educators have evolved and expanded in recent years; the preparation of emerging university faculty leaders must focus on the development of the knowledge; skills; and strategies for teaching and learning in higher education. This short course is designed to introduce the strategies and exemplars of university teaching skills necessary to meet these new professional demands for teaching at a university level.  ,Appropriate for all,?

You learn to do all of this with natural and efficient techniques. Natural because all you need is your body to create the movements and the breathing techniques that I show you step-by-step; and efficient because it only takes 10 minutes a day and you can do them anywhere; at home or on the road or in a hotel or at a friend s house. Just imagine; what would it feel like to have more energy through the day? How would it feel NOT to have to fight that annoying fatigue when you have so much to do? In this Boosting Energy course I will teach you how to wake up your natural energy (because you have more energy than you are using right now) and then how to end your fatigue. Did you know your own energy goes dormant and then is wasted if you don t know how to access it? You learn how to reverse that process in this course. Here are the Top 8 Benefits of the 10 Minute Daily Invigorator routines according to initial user testimonials: 1. Evening Energy Boost Power: You will get through your day with a constant and natural source of energy and still have enough oomf to tackle your personal projects in the evenings. 2. Clarity to Solve Problems: Your mind will buzz with new ideas and you will solve your problems and overcome roadblocks much better with a new sense of clarity. 3. Single-minded Focus for Productivity: You will be able to focus more intently on a single task at a time; which ultimately makes you far more productive. Goodbye multitasking! 4. Higher Efficiency and Time Saving: When you are focused with clarity of mind; you become more efficient. You start to take control of your time. You avoid distractions. You accomplish more in less time with a happier state of mind and body. 5. Pleasant Around Your Family: You will be less stressed; less impatient; and less tense around your family and friends when you feel more energized and relaxed in your body. Everyone benefits from this one! 6. Natural Interest in Healthy Eating: When your body feels energized and invigorated; it starts to crave healthy food without you forcing it into anything; your body just pulls you into a healthier direction. 7. Boost in Creativity: When you do the breathing exercises; they clear your mind of worry and stress and other roadblocks. When you are able to open those pathways; your creativity starts to flow. Ideas will come to you even during the 10 minute routine as you fill your body with energy and breath. 8. Deep Sense of Happiness: Your body awakens its own natural energy with these unique routines and you feel in balance and harmony with everything around you. The 10 minute Invigorator on How to Increase Energy works as long as you are willing to give it a chance. You don t need any prior exercise or yoga or any other experience. You don t need to be flexible or strong - yet you will get both of those side-benefits with the program.  I made this course in such a way that anyone can do it. I show you modifications and I talk you through all the moves methodically. You are going to have fun and increase your productivity in this unique approach to tapping into your internal energy!</p>,Appropriate for all,?

These coins can then be traded in for cool stuff such as music downloads and gift cards etc. Your videos (and video pages!) will be all over Facebook; Twitter; and other Social Media Networks. They are eye catching and different. You will not have seen anything like this anywhere before! By creating a ViewTrakr page; you will engage your audience.

Have you considered graduate study in finance? Are you working in an investment bank; money-management firm or hedge fund and you want to understand models better? Would you like to know what buzzwords like beta; risk premium; risk-neutral price; arbitrage; and discount factor mean? This class is for you. We will see how one basic idea; price equals expected discounted payoff; unites everything - models that describe stocks; bonds; options; real investments; discrete time; continuous time; asset pricing; portfolio theory; and so forth.  We ll start with the underlying consumption-based model; and we’ll preview the classic issues in finance. We’ll think about asset pricing in a simple economic equilibrium. Then; we ll take a step back and study contingent claims and the theorems showing the existence of a discount factor (the m in p=E(mx)). We ll explore the mean-variance frontier and expected return vs. beta models and factor structures. A brief tour of current facts and puzzles follows. Then; off to study options and the Black-Scholes formula; bond pricing models and facts. We will close with modern portfolio theory.  The math in real finance is not actually that hard. Understanding how to use the equations; and see what they really mean about the world... that s hard; and that s what I hope will be uniquely rewarding about this class.,Appropriate for all,?

You re absolutely right. I would like to change that review for you; but I think I m not subscribed to the course anymore; I cannot find it on my completed courses site. Do you know if there is a way I can change the review. Btw - since I enrolled in your course; I watched more than 40 courses on Udemy; and yours was really good compared to some others.

It s part of Tom Cassidy s Reason-Ability series. Meta studies of the characteristics of exceptional teaching point to a number of key qualities that these teachers possess. My own research on the impact of teaching on student outcomes; from 2005-2012 using the 4Matrix system; supports these findings and I have now extended these conclusions into an actionable framework. 2. How does it work? There are 9 broad characteristics of exceptional teaching; each representing either something teachers believe or something they do. In order to develop these characteristics; you concentrate on just one aspect at a time; on a weekly basis until you have covered all 9. This takes 9 weeks. At that point; you repeat the cycle and continue to repeat it until you have completed the cycle 4 times. This takes 36 weeks which corresponds with the length of the academic year; hence The 9x4. The idea of ‘One thing at a time’ as a developmental tool is not new. It was first turned into a system by Benjamin Franklin who used it to master the skills he required to develop his character. It has often been referred to as the Franklin 13; or Franklin’s Thirteen virtues; since he was working on the full 52 weeks in a year and 13x4 = 52.,Appropriate for all,?

We should not forget the community structure and norms constrain for encouraging individual health behaviors. This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote the public’s health. We begin by examining the various definitions of ‘community’ and the processes by which we ‘diagnose’ or seek to understand the structure and characteristics of different types of communities. An appreciation of community similarities and differences is necessary lest we fall into the trap of designing one-size-fits-all interventions. We need to recognize that no matter that outsiders may view a community as poor or neglected; we can find strengths and capacities for improvement in each community. Identifying community capacities and resources is the first step in facilitating community change. Different practical and philosophical approaches to change and therefore; examined. Specific to the change process is our recognition of the need for communities to participate in the design; implementation and evaluation of any intervention. We examine the concept of participation in an effort to see how different levels of involvement may affect sustainability of community change efforts. Finally a case study of a community participatory approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa is presented. Community Directed Intervention has subsequently been successfully applied to providing other essential primary health care services by and in the community; such as insecticide treated bednets; malaria treatment; vitamin A distribution; deworming medicines; and pneumonia and diarrhea case management.,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Automata; Coursera; online Math and Science courses,N/A,Online Course - Automata,Coursera,Free,6 weeks,Yes,Jeffrey Ullman; Professor,I am pleased to be able to offer free over the Internet a course on Automata Theory; based on the material I have taught periodically at Stanford in the course CS154. Students have access to screencast lecture videos; are given quiz questions; assignments and exams; receive regular feedback on progress; and can participate in a discussion forum. Those who successfully complete the course will receive a statement of accomplishment. You will need a decent Internet connection for accessing course materials; but should be able to watch the videos on your smartphone. The course covers four broad areas: (1) Finite automata and regular expressions; (2) Context-free grammars; (3) Turing machines and decidability; and (4) the theory of intractability; or NP-complete problems. Why Study Automata Theory? This subject is not just for those planning to enter the field of complexity theory; although it is a good place to start if that is your goal. Rather; the course will emphasize those aspects of the theory that people really use in practice. Finite automata; regular expressions; and context-free grammars are ideas that have stood the test of time. They are essential tools for compilers. But more importantly; they are used in many systems that require input that is less general than a full programming language yet more complex than  push this button.  The concepts of undecidable problems and intractable problems serve a different purpose. Undecidable problems are those for which no computer solution can ever exist; while intractable problems are those for which there is strong evidence that; although they can be solved by a computer; they cannot be solved sufficiently fast that the solution is truly useful in practice. Understanding this theory; and in particular being able to prove that a problem you are facing belongs to one of these classes; allows you to justify taking another approach — simplifying the problem or writing code to approximate the solution; for example. During the course; I m going to prove a number of things. The purpose of these proofs is not to torture you or confuse you. Neither are the proofs there because I doubt you would believe me were I merely to state some well-known fact. Rather; understanding how these proofs; especially inductive proofs; work; lets you think more clearly about your own work. I do not advocate proofs that programs are correct; but whenever you attempt something a bit complex; it is good to have in mind the inductive proofs that would be needed to guarantee that what you are doing really works in all cases.,Appropriate for all,?

Pritchard; Colin Fredericks; Alwina Liu,*Note - This is an Archived course* This is a past/archived course. At this time; you can only explore this course in a self-paced fashion. Certain features of this course may not be active; but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course. Mechanics ReView is a second look at introductory Newtonian Mechanics. It will give you a unified overview of mechanics that will dramatically increase your problem-solving ability. It is open to any students who meet the prerequisites (see right); but is especially designed for teachers and those who want to improve their existing understanding of mechanics. Newtonian mechanics is the study of how forces change the motion of objects. This course begins with force; and moves on to straight-line motion; momentum; mechanical energy; rotational motion; and angular momentum. Optional units include oscillations; planetary orbits; and a review of multi-concept problems. Why Take Our Course? Our approach to mechanics is a unique one. Through worked examples and online texts we introduce a strategic overview of core concepts in mechanics. This overview couples with a new approach to problem-solving that will help you break down and solve multi-concept problems. By choosing a system of objects; defining their interactions; and deciding on a model to use to describe them; you will come to solve physics problems more easily and more systematically. The road to  easy  goes through  hard.  This course is more challenging than a standard high school or introductory college physics offering. We will help you become a more expert problem solver; and that process involves solving a variety of problems; in many different ways; with our new approach. The reward is stronger problem-solving ability that carries over to other areas in physics. Take this course to better organize your mechanics knowledge; to prepare for AP or advanced standing exams; to teach more effectively; or if you enjoy attacking challenging problems! For Teachers If you are a teacher looking to improve your knowledge of mechanics; or to learn new approaches to teach your students; we encourage you to sign up. Our approach has been researched carefully and has proven effectiveness when it comes to preparing students for later courses. Teachers in the United States; and especially in Massachusetts; can receive extra benefit from this course. We offer Professional Development Points (PDPs) at no charge to teachers in Massachusetts who complete our course. If you are in a different state; we instead offer Continuing Education Units through the American Association of Physics Teachers. There is a fee for this certificate.,Appropriate for all,?

Join us for the fun and challenge of using a Theraball with Wall Yoga. Come full circle; while learning how to steady your mind and body with over eleven innovative Theraball/Wall Yoga exercises by Colette Barry. With the buoyancy of ball work and the immovable force of the wall; you can move and balance your body to reach muscles you ve never thought possible! . . . . . . . . . . Besides developing good overall muscle tone for your entire body; the ball provides numerous other benefits that range anywhere from rehabilitating back; hip; and knee injuries; to delivering a powerful workout to improve core stability; posture; and muscle balance. You also improve your flexibility and your cardiovascular system by using a low-impact workout. Following are a few of the most important benefits for anyone wanting to use the ball and wall work and get a little background on what exactly you re supposed to be working. . . . . . . . . . . . . . BACK AND SPINE HEALTH The ball is great if you have back problems because it supports your lower back as you exercise and stretch. And that s exactly why physical therapists and chiropractors started using the ball for therapy. So many people suffer from back strain and injuries these days; that thinking of anyone you know who hasn t is a challenge. What other object can you think of that you can simply lay your body over and feel instant relief? CORE STABILITY With so much talk these days about working your  core ; you may be wondering what your core actually is. Well; the core is the muscles in your body that stabilize and support all your movements. Your core; or what people used to call your  midsection ; is made up of the deep abdominal and back muscles that work as stabilizers for your entire body. These muscles are the  deep  muscles because; although you cannot see them; they maintain the core stability in your body. Training on the ball is one way to work this group of hard-to-reach muscles. Just by sitting on the ball; you re able to activate the stabilizer muscles and not only improve your posture; but you also feel more in-touch with your center of gravity. This is just one of the many benefits you get from adding exercise balls to your fitness program. . . . . . . . . . . SCROLL BELOW TO READ MY BIO.

Send an email to marco.masi@gmail.com from your school/department mail account and you will get the coupon. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ A course on quantum physics for everyone; which will lead you by hand as clearly as possible from the abc of quantum mechanics to the most recent experiments and its philosophical implications. This course does not only introduce you to the basics of quantum theory; but covers also with a simple and non academic approach topics and several experiments that usually are discussed only among specialists. We review the standard concepts like the wave-particle duality; Heisenberg`s uncertainty principle; Schrödinger`s cat; the vacuum zero-point energy and virtual particles; among several others. Then we deepen the subject analysing quantum entanglement; the so called  EPR paradox  which question our naive understanding of the meaning of reality and locality; together with other effects and ground braking discoveries of the last century physics. Another; more advanced section; and that is usually not explained to the popular audience in an accurate but clear and understandable way to the public; is what I call the  quantum philosophical experiments ; like the  which way ;  quantum erasure ;  delayed choice ;  interaction free  and  quantum teleportation  experiments. This course is unique in the sense that; after delivering a historic introduction and the foundations; getting rid of typical popular misunderstandings; it discusses also several topics which go to the essence of the quantum phenomena; making it available for the first time in an easy understandable way to everyone. It is for those who always wanted to understand the principles of quantum physics; but are not physicist. For those who always have been attracted by the fascinating and weird quantum world; but found only advanced level university courses; or superficial popular science hypes where you couldn t discriminate between serious sensical and nonsensical stuff and between scientific and pseudo-scientific theories. For those who searched for a course that explains the basics of quantum mechanics; but that does not presuppose a technical preparation; and yet furnishes the most rigorous account as far a non mathematical exposition allows for. By covering the basics of quantum theory; from its birth about a century ago until today s modern research; its aim is to deliver the material necessary so that you will be able by yourself to distinguish between mere speculative (and more or less extravagant) interpretations in fashion; and the real experimental facts.,Appropriate for all,?

How about 742 × 300? Or 4821 ÷ 9? Most of us; when faced with math problems like these; immediately reach for a calculator or a pen. But imagine if you could perform these and other seemingly difficult—but surprisingly easy—calculations right in your head. Seems like an impossible feat? It’s not. One key to improving and expanding your math potential—whether you’re a corporate executive or a high-school student—lies in the powerful ability to perform mental math calculations. Solving basic math problems in your head is a gateway to success in understanding and mastering higher mathematical fields such as algebra; statistics; and calculus. It’s a skill that offers other lifelong benefits; including ·giving you a competitive edge in school or at work; ·keeping your mind active and sharp at any age; ·improving your performance on standardized tests; and ·learning to solve problems by using a variety of methods. Mental mathematics also is valuable in your everyday life; such as when shopping for groceries or figuring out how much to tip at a restaurant. And perhaps the best part? Learning how to do mental math can be fun—especially when you’re learning in the company of Professor Arthur T. Benjamin of Harvey Mudd College; one of the most engaging and entertaining members of The Great Courses faculty. The Secrets of Mental Math; his exciting new 12-lecture course; guides you through all the essential skills; tips; and tricks for improving and enhancing your ability to solve a range of mathematical problems right in your head. Mental Math—Made Simple Mental math; as Professor Benjamin demonstrates; is not as daunting as it may seem. In fact; it’s an ability you already have—you just may not know it. Performing calculations in your head is all just a process of breaking down a large problem into simpler and simpler problems until it’s finally reduced to a single answer. Assuming no detailed knowledge of mathematics other than what you learned in elementary school; Professor Benjamin has designed The Secrets of Mental Math to be accessible to anyone looking to tap into or strengthen his or her mental calculating skills. In the first part of the course; you focus on specific strategies for performing the basic nuts-and-bolts operations of mental mathematics. ·Adding any two numbers up to three digits ·Subtracting any two numbers up to three digits ·Multiplying any two numbers up to two digits ·Dividing any number by a number up to two digits Professor Benjamin fills each lecture with a wealth of practice problems to follow along with and get you engaged in the joys of mentally solving math problems. Once you’ve gotten these four fundamental operations down; you then branch out into some interesting directions that continue to hone your mental math skills. Among the exciting skills you’ll develop are ·how to find approximate answers using the art of “guesstimation”; ·how to quickly find squares and square roots; ·how to improve your memory for numbers (including phone and credit card numbers) by using a simple phonetic code; ·how to approach enormous calculations with increased confidence and accuracy; ·how to mentally determine the day of the week of any date in history; and ·how to do rapid pencil-and-paper mathematics in ways seldom taught in school. And his accompanying course guidebook is filled with additional problems you can use to practice your newfound skills. Discover Valuable Mathematical Tips and Techniques Throughout The Secrets of Mental Math; Professor Benjamin leads you through some fun—and memorable—techniques for tackling specific mathematical calculations. Here’s an example of one strategy he calls “Create a Zero; Kill the Zero;” helpful for determining the divisibility of any odd number that doesn’t end in 5. Is 1232 a multiple of 7? ·Start by adding or subtracting a multiple of 7 to create a 0 at the end (1232 + 28 = 1260). ·Kill the 0 from the new number (1260 becomes 126). ·Add or subtract a multiple of 7 to create another zero at the end (126 + 14 = 140); then kill the 0 at the end. ·Determine whether the new number is a multiple of the original divisor (Yes; it’s 14). ·Thus; 1232 is a multiple of 7. An Encouraging; Rewarding Look at Numbers But you’ll get more than just fun strategies to help make mental math easier. Learning with Professor Benjamin is like having a supportive coach right by your side—someone to encourage you; challenge you; and instill mathematical confidence in you. It’s this same teaching method that has won him a host of prestigious awards from the Mathematical Association of America; including the Deborah and Franklin Tepper Haimo Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics. So prepare yourself for an unforgettable adventure in mental mathematics. Enjoyable; eye-opening; and immensely rewarding; The Secrets of Mental Math makes basic math quicker and easier than ever before. And it’s a powerful way to take your first; more confident steps into the intriguing—and undeniably fun—world of numbers. ABOUT YOUR PROFESSOR Dr. Arthur T.

Believe it or not; it doesn t matter if you think you have a good memory or not. The information in this course will teach you: • Why memory is like a bicycle everyone can ride (with some minor personal adjustments). • The real reason why no one should ever be squeamish about memorization techniques or memorizing names and faces. • Why and how some of the most famous memory skills are applicable to learning and memorizing any name. • How to use memory techniques for storing and recalling any name you wish. • Examples of how to turn boring names into exciting and unforgettable images. (Learn how to do this and you ll be able to memorize ANYTHING). • Unique memorization techniques that will have you literally “tuning in” on new people that you meet. (Believe it or not; your mind wants you to greet people this way). • The weakest; the middling and the most potent ways of memorizing names and faces. • Simple memorization technique examples that walk you through the process. • Two secret ways to use relaxation to aid the memorization process so that you memorize and recall names naturally and with ease. These two methods alone are worth the price of this course because they will literally eliminate stress from your body as you memorize new names the instant you hear them. • And much; much more … These memorization techniques have been used by thousands of people; most of whom previously considered themselves owners of a “bad memory” to make real strides in memorizing names and faces. Don’t worry! None of these memorization techniques are rocket science. Frankly; if you can memorize a short email address or the name of a movie; then you can use this system to memorize anyone’s name that you wish. But there’s really no time to lose. Every day that you are not using this simple memorization technique; you are literally stealing from yourself the joy of memorizing and recalling the names of the important new people you meet as you easily expand the natural abilities of your mind.,Appropriate for all,?

My life is different now… I am inspired and excited about the days ahead. ” ~ Nancy Lopez; Anti-Procrastination Course Participant “The results were extraordinary. Since starting your class; I have been getting so much more done.” ~ Diana Diehl; Anti-Procrastination Course participant When was the last time you jeopardized or almost jeopardized your goals because of your procrastination? When was the last time you scrambled madly in the last minute to meet a deadline/submit a report/study because you were “busy” procrastinating in the days/weeks prior? If the above situations apply to you; you are not alone. Every day; ten thousands of people experience procrastination in different areas of their lives. From putting off exercising; to neglecting their diet; to surfing Facebook; to procrastinating pursuing their passion; to not studying; procrastination is like a termite that eats away people’s lives. Myself; I used to be a heavy procrastinator. In school; I would put off studying for exams. I put off doing assignments and projects because I hated doing them. When it was vacation time; I put off getting a job because I couldn’t be bothered to work. In the area of health and fitness; I wanted to lose weight but I kept playing lip service to exercising and eating right. I also procrastinated building relationships even though relationships are important in one’s life. Then; things changed. During my early 20s; I became a natural go-getter. I became the Dean’s Lister in my faculty and graduated as the top student in my specialization. At work; I was a consistent strong performer. When I realized it was time to pursue my passion; I handed my resignation letter right away and started my personal development business. My blog — Personal Excellence — soon took off. Today; I do what I love and earn money doing it because I took action on my dreams five years ago. Contrary to what many think; my consistent action has nothing to do with discipline. Neither does it have to do with me being naturally motivated. My natural “ability” to take action comes from having figured out how to overcoming procrastination--permanently. Through my years of personal growth; I have worked through the underpinnings behind procrastination. Today; I m able to take action whenever I want; wherever I want. Imagine being able to do anything you want; whenever you want; wherever you want. How much could you achieve in such a life? How accomplished would you become? I say you would without a doubt be more accomplished than you have ever been; because now you are busy making waves in your life through consistent action rather than wasting minutes; even hours; procrastinating every day. Well; you can be that natural go-getter and top achiever if you want. I m excited to share the Anti-Procrastination Course; my four-week intensive course to help YOU tackle the underlying roots of your procrastination and unleash that top-achiever; go-getter in you. It is my no-frills and no-nonsense course which shares my secrets to tackling procrastination and how you can eliminate procrastination--for life!,Appropriate for all,?

Whether you are taking Course 1; 2; or 3 of the series; each course includes a combinaton of these six parts for your total training. The most important aspect of Yoga with Perumal is the ability to grow progressively from yoga forms and a sequence that may be followed at one’s own pace from beginner through advanced. Again; please go at your own pace! Each video lecture is designed to give you the most comprehensive view of each pose since I provide 3 different camera angles for all asana (postures) to show you a lateral; frontal; and overhead perspective. Each video also has supportive text to reveal any hidden aspects of yoga and is accompanied by a supportive manual for total understanding of each pose.  In this course; you will find:  the complete Course Series 2; which includes 4 long progressive lessons named 2A - 2D. the complete Short Series on Pranayama; Preparatory; Saluation and Stretching. amazingly detailed manuals for both Course 2A - 2D and of the Short series to provide additional information on the video lessons. The Course Series 2 is a step-by-step development form that progresses from least challenging to most dynamic postures. Course 2A - 2D videos areapproximately 45 - 60 minutes in length so if you only have 5-25 minutes of practise time; work with the Short Series. It is always best to start at the beginning of each Short Series before going to the higher levels.  Once you have mastered Course 1 & 2; I hope you will continue your practice with the final course series on Course 3; and continue mastering the Short Series that is found in each of the different courses.  Thank you for your interest in Yoga with Perumal and I hope you enjoy the series!    ,Appropriate for all,?

The skills they didn t teach you in school. Most of us have sat through a career counseling session while we were getting ready to graduate college; but the advice they gave us was generic and vague:  tweak your resume;   network;   apply to jobs in your industry.  What are we supposed to do with that? This job hunt course is about more than just  tweaking your resume.  This in-depth job search course takes you step-by-step through the process of finding your first  real  job after college. You ll learn how to choose an industry/career path; narrow it down with a personal brand message; build a network that actually helps you find a job and master the interview process. We ll also cover how to refine your resume and align it with your brand message; crafting an amazing job application and negotiating the salary you deserve. By the end of the course you will have a solid understanding of what you need to do to find a job and how to nail the job interview. What materials are included? Everything you need to complete the course is included. Several lessons include supplementary materials and worksheets to help you find a job. How is the course structured? The course is divided into 5 sections; with each section containing 2-4 lessons. Each lesson can be taken as a stand alone unit; but the course is designed to be completed chronologically. Why take this course? Growing up; my Dad was always changing jobs and moving up the  corporate ladder.  I watched and learned a lot from him. When it came time for me to get my first job after college; I found one right away (in under a week); even though the country was in the middle of the recession. My friends were having a ton of trouble finding jobs and I couldn t understand why. After talking with them I realized that a lot of the things I learned from my Dad about job hunting are not taught in school. Since then; I ve had a few more jobs and moved to NYC. I currently work on commercials and movies for a special effects company. I made this course to share what I ve learned and help other people find a great job after college.,Appropriate for all,?

During this process of change; the capital of a military empire that once invaded East Asia experienced occupation by the U.S. armed forces; hosted the Olympic Games; and transformed into a consumer hub where young people could enjoy economic “wealth.” It is important to know that this process was recorded in countless photographs; documentary films; TV programs; and so on. We will retrieve many of these archived pictures and videos and analyze what happened in postwar Tokyo from different perspectives. In Part 1; you will look at the changes that occurred in postwar Tokyo over a quarter of a century from four different perspectives: 1) occupation by the U.S. armed forces; 2) consumption of images of the Emperor and the Imperial Household and redefinition as the imperial capital; 3) construction of the Olympic city Tokyo; and 4) changes in Shinjuku as a site of chaos and diversity. This examination of urban history will provide you with the insights necessary when considering changes in other large cities in Asia; such as Seoul; Beijing; and Bangkok; at the end of the twentieth century.

What’s more; at the end there is a free bonus HTML/CSS course!” — Alexander Popov 3 big reasons why this is THE web dev technology to learn Web gurus are calling Ruby on Rails the fastest; most efficient; most productive way to build web applications. I call it today’s “must-know” web-building technology. Ruby on Rails is THE programming language-and-framework combo to learn for three big reasons. First; because website owners want its benefits like fast; affordable app development. Second; because programmers’ customers want it; Ruby on Rails programmers are in high demand. And third; Ruby on Rails is fun and fast to use! As the web grows; organizations find they need new applications to support their business structures; to manage data; and to make the most of new marketplace opportunities. And they need new; custom apps to make themselves stand out from their competition. Hence; the need for new applications is exploding. Application development has always been pricey; so anything that speed app development is revolutionary. And if it can bring development cost down; too; it’s nothing short of a breakthrough. That’s why Ruby on Rails is so brilliant. High quality app development — fast and affordable Ruby on Rails; often called simply “Rails;” allows companies; organizations; startups; and developers to build apps quickly and with low cost. This vastly increases their flexibility and gives them market advantage. It also reduces an organization’s risk. All in all; Ruby on Rails provides a perfect formula for web app development success. This course gives you all the background; info; and hands-on training you need to help you engineer high-quality sites using Ruby on Rails. Here’s an important tip: Ruby is a programming language; Rails is a web application framework you’ll build your apps on. Put ‘em together and you’ve got Ruby on Rails — a system to build great apps quickly and easily. Fast-start technology; fast-start course Our Ruby on Rails tutorial for beginners is a fast start course built from the ground up using Rails 3.2. You’ll be prepped to start right in using the current release version. It’s Ruby on Rails training for those new to this system but you should have some experience in computer programming — ideally; some experience in Object Orientation. You’ll learn all about Ruby on Rails at Masters level; so it’s truly a living course. Materials will be updated as new versions of Rails are developed. And your instructor will respond to questions and requests. And he’ll even create new content if you ask for it. “I’ll create additional content where there is a demand;” says your instructor; Professor Paul Krause; “Unless I genuinely doubt the relevance or value of what has been requested!” Finally! An easy way to make quality apps quickly You’ll start by learning the basics of the Ruby programming language. You’ll specifically focus on the Ruby features that Rails can use to support productivity and quality. Then; one by one; you’ll learn the key features of the Rails framework. Process is important in Ruby on Rails so you’ll study a chapter that shows you how to put Example Projects under Version Control and adopt Continuous Testing. You’ll learn how to use RSpec and Cucumber to drive your development by first specifying the behavior that’s required; and then by incrementally delivering until your tests show that you’ve satisfied those requirements. You’ll also learn how to use Version Control and deploy your Increments into Heroku so that your customer may review them. And you’ll be introduced to the IDE RubyMine. Bonus materials; too But besides learning about Rails; you’ll also get a good grounding of standards-based development on the client side using HTML5; CSS3; and JavaScript. And — bonus! — you’ll gain some background material on Object Modeling to help you understand the Business Model at the heart of your application. As a Framework; Rails gives you tons of tools to supercharge your productivity and get all the fun of building great web applications. This course also shows you how to get additional horsepower by accessing the Rails Ecosystem (or programmer community) and the Gems that Ecosystem members contribute freely. Here’s what you’ll learn in “Everything You Need to Know About Ruby on Rails” – You’ll get lifetime access to over 53 lectures and 16 hours of valuable content. You’ll understand the Basics of Ruby. You’ll get to know the MVC architecture of Rails. You’ll learn how Rails supports the Development of Models. You’ll see how Rails supports the Development of Views. You’ll discover Best Practice in the use of HTML5 and CSS3. You’ll see Best Practice in Behavioral Driven Development. You’ll understand how to use an extensive range of Ruby Gems to maximize productivity. You’ll learn how to use CSS3 Animations. You’ll become experienced in Responsive Design. NEW materials — just added! We have just added new material on Rails 4 and Ruby 2.0. There’s a new Advanced Section; as well as new and improved introductory information; too. As you learn about Rails 4; you’ll learn exactly how to stream live data from the server into an HTML element in a View on the Client’s browser. Yes; Rails can now cover some of the use cases that; up ‘til now; needed a move to node.js. You’ll see this dramatic demonstration and learn how to do it yourself!,Appropriate for all,?

Pathological factors; including acidogenic bacteria; salivary dysfunction; and dietary carbohydrates are related to caries progression.  Protective factors; which include antibacterials; salivary calcium; phosphate and proteins; salivary flow; and fluoride in saliva can balance; prevent or reverse dental caries through a process of remineralization.  Remineralization is a natural and reliable repair mechanism for non-cavitated carious lesions. This course will provide the scientific basis behind the “caries balance” concept; which is the key to caries management by risk assessment in clinical practice.  If pathological factors prevail caries progresses.  If protective factors prevail the caries process is halted or reversed. The course will present tools to implement  CAMBRA; “caries management by risk assessment;” in your clinical setting.  It can be in implemented medical and dental settings; and can benefit children and adults of all ages.

Research-based instructional strategies utilized in STEM programs require a more rigorous approach to describing the scientific ideas that underlie the activity.  The question becomes: As teachers begin to address the Science Core Disciplinary Ideas through the lens of STEM (Science; Engineering; Technology and Mathematics) instructional strategies; how and why should the Scientific and Engineering Design Practices be integrated into investigations? Using the Framework for K-12 Science Education can be the basis for this depth of understanding by: ·       Providing research-based science core disciplinary ideas ·       Connecting the ideas with Cross-cutting concepts ·       Utilizing scientific and engineering practices and ·       Providing guidance in the assessment of the depth of knowledge gained by students and a measure of achievement in understanding the core disciplinary ideas in science.,Appropriate for all,?

The course will explain the basic principles for design of randomized clinical trials and how they should be reported.  In the first part of the course; students will be introduced to terminology used in clinical trials and the several common designs used for clinical trials; such as parallel and cross-over designs.  We will also explain some of the mechanics of clinical trials; like randomization and blinding of treatment.  In the second half of the course; we will explain how clinical trials are analyzed and interpreted.  Finally; we will review the essential ethical consideration involved in conducting experiments on people.,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Economics of Money and Banking; Part One; Coursera; online Business courses,N/A,Online Course - Economics of Money and Banking; Part One,Coursera,Free,7 weeks,Yes,N/A,The last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking; this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant. Three features of the new system are central. Most important; the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this; and then that; in an effort to stem the collapse.   Second; the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system; which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse; and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order.  Third; absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts; most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance; nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That s the reason this course places dealers; in both capital markets and money markets; at the very center of the picture; as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.,Appropriate for all,?

The aim of the second course is to teach the principles of reactive programming. Reactive programming is an emerging discipline which combines concurrency and event-based and asynchronous systems. It is essential for writing any kind of web-service or distributed system and is also at the core of many high-performance concurrent systems. Reactive programming can be seen as a natural extension of higher-order functional programming to concurrent systems that deal with distributed state by coordinating and orchestrating asynchronous data streams exchanged by actors. In this course you will discover key elements for writing reactive programs in a composable way. You will find out how to apply these building blocks in the construction of event-driven systems that are scalable and resilient.The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them; modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments; which are also programming projects. Personalized Tutoring by Typesafe: Typesafe offers supervised tutorial sessions accompanying select Coursera classes. In weekly; one-hour tutorial sessions experts from Typesafe provide in-depth answers to questions about the course material; and discuss solutions to homework assignments past the deadline.

In this course; topics include: The electrical charging of active membranes from the creation and use of differences in ionic concentrations across the membrane. The stimulation of the membrane; both naturally and from engineered sources. The creation of action potentials by the membrane in response to stimulation. The chain reaction of membrane responses; with each small region or cell initiating an action potential in adjacent ones. The observation of associated electrical currents in terms of extracellular wave voltages they create; the basis of clinical measurements such as the electrocardiogram. The course will at each step present equations and other quantitative reasoning so that you will be able to go beyond describing what happens qualitatively and be able to link together the phenomena in the mosaic in a quantitative fashion; which is essential to judging whether specific changes in inputs are important to the outcome. Through the use of quantitative analysis; you will learn that all the elements of the system are tied together and be able to link together and analyze the effects of one part on another.,Appropriate for all,?

Furthermore; violence does not occur in a vacuum; the consequences are also felt through other medical conditions and health behaviors and individuals; families; and communities affected by violence are often irreparably altered. Violence is a complex problem and can only be understood and reduced though a multidisciplinary approach.  The course will cover the epidemiology of violence; roots of violence including biological; psychological; and social causes (e.g.; economic deprivation; religious factors); specific types of violence; media and the arts portrayal of violence; the business/economic impact of violence; physical and mental consequence; and ways to control and prevent violence in our communities; including criminal justice and public health approaches.  Through these perspectives; the course will demonstrate the ways in which multi-disciplinary scholarship can deepen our understanding of the complexities of violence in local; national; and global contexts and how we can help develop solutions.  ,Appropriate for all,?

Es el primer mes del curso; Inglés en 9 Meses para Bebés y la Familia. En este curso pretendo enseñarte a usar el inglés que usaría cualquier padre o madre de habla inglesa con sus hijos. Y lo aprenderás con sólo 5 minutos al día y en 9 Meses. ¿Porqué? Pues; porque se trata de vocabulario y frases que no se enseñan en los libros ni en las academias de inglés. Porque como padres a todos nos preocupa que nuestros hijos puedan hablar inglés de mayores; y resulta que si les exponemos al idioma desde pequeñitos tendrán más posibilidades de ser bilingües. Porque el cerebro de los niños está especialmente adaptado a la adquisición de idiomas; y esta capacidad merma considerablemente a partir de los 6 años. Porque los niños aprenden los idiomas estando expuestos a él y necesitamos crear un entorno donde el inglés sea habitual y constante; y eso sólo lo podemos conseguir los padres en casa. Porque los padres pueden aprovechar la motivación de enseñar a sus hijos para mejorar su propio nivel o empezar a aprender inglés. Cómo funciona el curso Abre una lección por día. Escucha y repite lo que escuchas. Trata de no leer ya que ahí empiezan los problemas de pronunciación. Imita el sonido. Memoriza las frases de la lección diaria y busca situaciones para practicarlas. Si tienes un smartphone o tablet; descarga la app de Udemy. Es tentador abrir todas las lecciones una tras otra. Pero si sigues el método que te propongo de una lección diaria te garantizo mayor éxito. Simplemente porque estarás creando un hábito de usar el inglés a diario; porque no te abrumarás con tanto nuevo que aprender; y te dará tiempo a memorizar las frases nuevas antes de pasar a las siguientes. Si sigues mi método de una lección diaria este curso tiene una duración de 1 mes. El curso incluye un PDF resumen que podrás descargarte de cada capítulo. Además incluye sugerencias a otros recursos en línea. Al final de cada capítulo hay un pequeño quiz-test interactivo para consolidar lo aprendido.

The course will cover three main topics: neuroanatomy; neural communication; and neural systems. We will start by exploring the overall organization of the human brain and the cellular building blocks of the brain – neurons. We will examine how the incredibly complex brain develops from a ball of embryonic cells and then look at the anatomy of nerves; the spinal cord; brainstem and forebrain. An understanding of how blood reaches the brain; the blood brain barrier; and the ventricular system will be used to understand different types of strokes. At the end of the units on neuroanatomy; students will have a strong understanding of nerve injury; spinal cord injury; traumatic brain injury; stroke; and brain tumors. In the neural communication module; we will look at how electrical potentials carry information within neurons and how neurotransmitters are used to communicate information between neurons. This module will illuminate what goes wrong in epilepsy; demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis; and myasthenia gravis as well as how nerve gas; Botox; cocaine and beta-blockers act on neurons. In the final module; all of the fundamental anatomy and physiology from the first two modules will be used to examine how 1) we perceive the outside world; 2) we act in the world either volitionally or emotionally; 3) our nervous system allows us to live; and 4) cognition works to make us the human individuals that we are. We will look at the neurobiology of everyday situations such as multitasking (walking and chewing gum) and at the ways in which the nervous system commonly fails us (e.g. motion sickness). Students will emerge from this module with an understanding of common medical problems such as Parkinson s disease; myopia; hearing loss; and fever. Throughout the course; the neurobiology of items relevant to the week’s topic (current events; YouTube videos; diseases) will be discussed in weekly forums.

Tripp,This course is about how your database’s physical design either takes advantage of or is hindered by the way that the SQL Server platform works; knowing this can give you better long-term scalability; availability; and performance. Choosing the right data types when you re designing your columns; tables; and indexes is really critical. Using the wrong data type can cause more space to be required; affecting data density in memory; database and backup size; transaction log efficiency; and more. It s even more important when you re choosing your clustering keys; as the wrong choice there can cause nonclustered index sizes to balloon dramatically. It can even affect the performance of queries; when incompatible data types are used in comparisons and cause very costly operations to take place. This course will show you how to make the right choices and avoid all of these problems. It starts by explaining the various data structures that are used to store columns and rows; and how they can be affected by data type choice. Then it shows how data type choice factors into clustered and nonclustered index key choice. Finally it describes the implicit conversion and probe residual problems that can occur from mismatched data types used in queries. Packed with a wealth of information and practical; easy-to-follow demonstrations; this course will show you how to make the RIGHT choices to make sure you avoid all these common problems. The course is applicable for all SQL Server versions from SQL Server 2005 onward; and for SQL Server developers and anyone responsible for designing and creating SQL Server tables and indexes; with any level of experience.,Intermediate,?

Tripp,This course is about how different ad hoc statement execution methods affect caching; plan reuse; memory and ultimately performance. Knowing when to use each method is important and understanding how SQL Server works will demystify certain behaviors you may have seen but previously have been unable to explain. SQL Server can support any workload; any design; and any data requests but knowing exactly which one is the most beneficial to use can give you better long-term scalability; availability; and performance. Using the wrong method can cause more memory to be wasted and even result in parameter sniffing problems (where subsequent statements perform poorly because of the plan that’s been cached). This course will show you how each statement execution method works; how it’s cached; whether or not it wastes cache; and finally how to test and rewrite the statement to take better advantage of caching. Along the way we will also cover a variety of other necessary features and tools: estimates; statistics; and heuristics; how to analyze query plans; some indexing strategies to improve performance; and plan guides. This course is an absolute must for everyone that works with SQL Server and it’s also an introduction to concepts that will be built upon in future courses. This course is applicable to all SQL Server versions from SQL Server 2005 onward; and for SQL Server developers as well as anyone responsible for writing data access statements to SQL Server tables. You can have any level of experience to gain from this course but those of you who have experienced what seemed odd behavior/performance with your ad hoc statements will probably benefit the most!,Intermediate,?

This is the focus of this Course. It is based on the instructor s research and thirty years of real-world experience advising private growth companies.   This Course will focus on the common “people” challenges private growth companies face as they grow. You will study stories of how six different private businesses faced their growth challenges.   While strategic focus and operational excellence are necessary to build a great growth company; they are not sufficient. Growth requires the right kind of leadership; culture; and people. My research clearly showed that many entrepreneurs struggle with personal challenges presented to them by growth; as well as the challenge of hiring the right people and building the right management team that can play well together. The research shows that every growth business faces common challenges. You can learn from others  experience—you do not have to  reinvent the wheel .   The Course format is story based. Each case tells a compelling story. You will learn from Barbara Lynch; Ryan Dienst; Steve Ritter; Randy Bufford; John Gabbert; and Mike Cote. In addition; each week; we will discuss a different content theme. In Week 3; you will engage in a Workshop where you will be asked to apply the Growth System Assessment Tool. You will have the opportunity to create a Course Community of fellow students to learn from each other as the Course progresses.   You will learn how entrepreneurs must grow; too; the “secret” of high performance; people-centric leadership; how to create high employee engagement; how to create an internal Growth System; and how to build a senior management team.,Appropriate for all,?

Once we have those basics down; we’ll go straight into creating our first application. First; I’ll show you how to create a hosted application which is an application that you can actually host on your own webserver; but is installed like any other mobile app on Firefox OS. Then; we’ll create another full application; as we learn how to create a packaged application that is able to access more of the APIs that Firefox OS only exposed to apps that are actually installed on the device. We’ll still use the same HTML 5 technologies you are used to for this application; but we won’t need to host the app ourselves; because the user will install in directly on their device. Finally; I’ll take you through the process of deploying your Firefox OS applications. We’ll talk about the different options you have for getting our application into users hands including distributing it yourself and using the Firefox Marketplace to host your apps. So; if you are excited about mobile; and want to learn about an exciting platform you can develop for that will allow you to reuse your existing HTML 5; JavaScript and CSS skills; you’ll definitely want to check out this course.,Intermediate,?

With the advent of the Internet; cloud computing; and open source software; the cost of building products is at an all-time low. Yet; the odds of building successful startups haven’t improved much. Most startups still fail. When entrepreneurs get hit by an idea they either rush towards building out their solution or rush towards finding investors. Both of these approaches take a lot of time and energy; and can be overwhelming. They are also backwards. The number one reason startups fail is not because they fail to build what they set out to build; but because they spend too much time; money; and effort building the wrong product. I attribute the entrepreneur’s; often unbridled and singular; passion for the solution as the top contributor to this failure. People place too much emphasis on the original idea but studies conducted on product success and failure tell a different story. It has been statistically shown that most initial ideas don t work as anticipated. Rather; what separates successful entrepreneurs isn t starting with that perfect idea (or Plan A) but finding a plan that works before running out of resources. That last part is key. This course will show you how.,Appropriate for all,?

Que “a mudança muda mais rápido do que podemos entender e nos adaptar; blá..blá..blá” .É um clichê que beira o insuportável e; se você é como eu ; já deve estar cheio desse papo. Será que ainda se pode dizer algo original e inspirador sobre “mudança”? Se ela é o dado central em nossas empresas e nossas vidas ; eu começaria perguntando: “Qual o insight mais inspirador sobre a ideia de mudança? “.Quem disse as coisa mais verdadeiras e originais sobre esse tema? O que sabemos hoje com certeza sobre o que é “mudar”? Charles Darwin mostrou que mudança que mantém vivo o que está vivo; se chama evolução. Ele estava interessado nas coisas vivas (não em planetas ou objetos inanimados como Newton); e concluiu; depois de décadas de pesquisa; que tudo o que é vivo é resultado; não de um ato criador isolado; não de um evento estático; mas de uma dinâmica que se desenrola há bilhões de anos e que; hoje sabemos; vale para empresas também. Para termos sucesso hoje ;na vida do dia-a-dia e na empresa; temos de saber interferir com essa coisa de mudança. Mudança tem que ser gerenciada; não pode mais ser deixada ao acaso. Quando essa interferência a que chamamos de gestão é bem sucedida nós damos a ela o apelido de”inovação. Quando é mal sucedida nós a chamamos de KODAK; Enciclopédia Britannica;Nokia; BlackBerry;Microsoft talvez… Nosso segundo curso no INNOVATRIX 5 minutos; chamado “O passo-a-passo do empreendedor”- que será anunciado semana que vem; vai começar com o estágio inicial na vida de qualquer organização que venha a ter sucesso.

Even though there are many solutions today for cross platform development on these platforms; many of the solutions either require you to use a single non-native user interface or create your user interface code multiple times. Appcelerator Titanium is an exciting way to build truly native Android and iOS applications using JavaScript which are able to reuse a large amount of code; even for the user interface. In this course; I ll take you through the process of getting setup with Appcelerator Titanium and fill you in on all the details of how exactly Titanium works and why it is so different than many other cross platform solutions. Throughout this course; we ll actually build a real mobile application that will run on both Android and iOS using Appcelerator Titanium and along the way learn about the platform and how to use it. We ll start off learning how to programmatically create a cross platform user interface in JavaScript and how to interact with the user interface and respond to events like button clicks. Then; we ll learn a bit about the different platform APIs that Titanium provides and how to expand our app to take into account multiple screens. After that; we ll learn about Alloy; a way to build Titanium applications using XML markup and style sheets using an MVC or Model View Controller approach; which can greatly simplify our code and make it much easier to design an application. Finally; in the last module; we ll tackle a few advanced concepts and learn about the awesome Titanium Cloud API; which allows us to create a full backend for our application without having to install any databases or design any complex schemas. So; if you are interested in cross platform application development and you d like to see how you can build truly cross platform native applications using JavaScript; you ll definitely want to check out this course.,Intermediate,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Introduction to Recommender Systems; Coursera; online Technology courses,N/A,Online Course - Introduction to Recommender Systems,Coursera,Free,14 weeks,Yes,N/A,Recommender systems have changed the way people find products; information; and even other people. They study patterns of behavior to know what someone will prefer from among a collection of things he has never experienced. The technology behind recommender systems has evolved over the past 20 years into a rich collection of tools that enable the practitioner or researcher to develop effective recommenders. We will study the most important of those tools; including how they work; how to use them; how to evaluate them; and their strengths and weaknesses in practice. The algorithms we will study include content-based filtering; user-user collaborative filtering; item-item collaborative filtering; dimensionality reduction; and interactive critique-based recommenders. The approach will be hands-on; with six two week projects; each of which will involve implementation and evaluation of some type of recommender. In addition to topical lectures; this course includes interviews and guest lectures with experts from both academia and industry. Two Ways to Take this Course: This course is designed to support two different types of students and educational goals: Programming Track:  Designed for students with significant programming and mathematics experience (see below); the programming track combines a conceptual and mathematical understanding of recommender systems with experience programming six different recommender systems projects.  Students completing this travel will gain the skills needed to implement basic recommenders from scratch; and to use software libraries and tools to implement more advanced recommenders. Concepts Track:  Students who are not experienced programmers; or who are primarily interested in understanding the concepts and techniques of recommender systems; without learning to program them; can choose to focus on the conceptual and mathematical content; skipping the programming projects and associated lecture content.  Students in the concepts track are still expected to have significant familiarity with computing systems and college-level mathematics; but need not be accomplished programmers.  We expect this track to be useful for tech-savvy marketing and business leaders; as well as engineering managers who may oversee but not directly develop recommender systems.  We also hope it will be useful to those looking to understand recommender systems concepts without the workload associated with programming those systems. ,Appropriate for all,?

Diwan; Salla Atkins,For the first hundreds of years of modern medicine; progress was a process of trial and error; and to be honest; it was often fatal error; such as bloodletting; which killed the first US president George Washington. Where diseases were clearly understood; and where treatments obviously worked on most patients; such as penicillin for pneumonia; there was no need to delve deeper into questions of effectiveness. But for most conditions; the treatment benefits were modest and there was a need for improved ways of telling whether a new intervention was better than the previous standard treatment. And so scientists introduced a testing procedure for new treatments - the randomized controlled trial. As the cost of developing new treatments grew; it became very important to detect the slightest improvement that could be attributed to the new drug in order to get it licensed and marketed. So the usual randomized trial was answering the following question: does this treatment work (for otherwise well people with just this single disease; with perfect adherence; treated by the best doctors; under idealised conditions)? But most patients have multiple diseases; imperfect adherence; ordinary doctors and non-ideal circumstances. These patients want to know whether a new treatment is likely to reduce important harms for ordinary people like them; receiving usual care. This mismatch meant that most trials were overestimating the real world effectiveness of new interventions. In this MOOC; we are going to study this mismatch; and see what its effect is on modern medical care. One example of the studies we will discuss is the VIGOR trial. This influential drug trial resulted in the widespread global overuse of this drug; at a cost of wasted billions of dollars. Ironically; this drug; intended to reduce a problem in individuals; ended up causing more of the same problem in the population! After we understand the consequences of designing the wrong kinds of trials; we will also look at how best to design pragmatic randomized trials; which answer the important questions that ordinary patients and decision makers in the real world most often ask. We will also explore how these can be combined with economic evaluations and qualitative research – to answer important questions about how much these interventions cost; and how they are experienced by the recipients.,Appropriate for all,?

So why use this approach?  One reason is that most of us are inductive learners; meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there.  Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive.  When we see where those concepts come from; we can more readily accept them; explain them; and apply them.  A second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes.  This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes.   A third reason is that this is simply more interesting! The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning.  It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together; rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.,Appropriate for all,?

St. Leger and Tammatha O Brien,In this class we will cover the essentials of genomics to help you better understand your own life (know thy genome; know thyself); and how advances in biotechnology are radically changing the scientific landscape. We will begin with some of the most basic issues of genetics; such as the composition of genomes and how the information in them is processed so we can get an adult human from an egg. Then we’ll see that much of the power of genomics is in comparisons. If I only had your genome there s not much I could do with it. But if I lined it up against a chimpanzee genome I’d see that they are 98.5% identical. It’s that 1.5% difference that we study to determine what makes a chimp a chimp and a human a human.  In the next few years you’ll be able to get your genome done for a few hundred dollars; and we will look at the challenges you might face dealing with this new self-knowledge. We shall particularly focus on behavior. How can genes predispose some of us to be nice and others of us to be psychopaths? We will be examining behavior as a complex unfolding of interactions between your genome and the environment. Thanks in large part to genomics we are beginning to understand the living processes that constitute ourselves; where we can begin to intervene to take control of our own future. We will look at the technologies involved and the consequences of this new power. Genetic engineering has already changed what you eat and the medicines you take; and will likely therefore change how long you live. If we choose to genetically engineer ourselves as some advocate then we may also change how we view ourselves as human beings. We do not know where our ability to intervene in our own living processes is going to lead us. Depending on your point of view that is the promise or the threat of the era we live in. Scientists today already envisage creating life from scratch; and we are entering a world where political considerations; and imagination; may be the only brakes on biotechnology.,Appropriate for all,?

During exercise; the muscle group breaks down muscle fibers in order to adapt to the workout and grow stronger with continued use. However; the frequent muscle fiber use and exercise will cause friction among the muscles and develop knots; adhesions; or scar tissues and becomes the root of the soreness and tightness the body will feel. Incidentally; these side effects become the cause of why the body cannot recover quickly and prevents continuing of exercise. KRANK Systems does not want this to prevent you from continuing your exercise routine and is the reason why we have developed different foam rolling techniques that will: * Prevent injuries * Reduce muscle friction and inflammation * Soothe tight muscles * Improve range of motion * Improve flexibility and movement * Increase blood flow and circulation to soft tissues * Increase recovery process Not only will our foam rolling techniques increase the recovery process so one can work out repeatedly without the soreness yet; it will also benefit prior to exercising for warming up and preparing the body to stand each workout. The Importance of Foam Rolling: The foam roller is an important tool that gym enthusiasts should own; and knowing how to foam roll can save you a lot of money down the road. We all want to be pain free and this will certainly help that cause. Foam rolling; also known as  the poor mans massage  helps release a lot of knots that everyone tends to carry. It is very important to untangle or release these knots in order for the body to move correctly and efficiently. It also helps create more blood circulation in the body and helps you achieve a better range of motion (R.O.M) through out your exercises. Foam rolling should be done as frequent as possible. Wouldn t you want a massage as frequently as possible? You should strive to roll out before and after workouts. Roll out anywhere from 10-20 minutes. We will also be giving our  Diet and Meal Guidline  to properly fuel your body.,Appropriate for all,?

Examples range from voting in a national election to deliberating with others in small committees. Many interesting philosophical and mathematical issues arise when we carefully examine our group decision-making processes.  There are two types of group decision making problems that we will discuss in this course. A voting problem: Suppose that a group of friends are deciding where to go for dinner. If everyone agrees on which restaurant is best; then it is obvious where to go. But; how should the friends decide where to go if they have different opinions about which restaurant is best? Can we always find a choice that is “fair” taking into account everyone’s opinions or must we choose one person from the group to act as a “dictator”? A fair division problem: Suppose that there is a cake and a group of hungry children. Naturally; you want to cut the cake and distribute the pieces to the children as fairly as possible. If the cake is homogeneous (e.g.; a chocolate cake with vanilla icing evenly distributed); then it is easy to find a fair division: give each child a piece that is the same size. But; how do we find a “fair” division of the cake if it is heterogeneous (e.g.; icing that is 1/3 chocolate; 1/3 vanilla and 1/3 strawberry) and the children each want different parts of the cake? ,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,The Story of Liberty ; Udemy; online Humanities courses,N/A,Online Course - The Story of Liberty,Udemy,Free,120.5 hours,Yes,John Bona,We believe the story of our God-given rights is the great missing link to restore our nation again. The great story of Liberty reaches its crescendo in America with the Mayflower Compact and the landing of the Pilgrim fathers almost 400 years ago. But the great story began in Nazareth when the author of liberty; Jesus gave His first sermon to his home synagogue. The story is detailed in Luke chapter 4. He opened the scroll to Isaiah 61 and read the Messianic prophecy of the purpose of the Messiah??s coming. He detailed that he came to heal the broken-hearted ; the blind; and to preach the Gospel to the poor. But when He came to the subject of Liberty he said he came to set the captives free; and then He repeated it a second time saying he came to set those that were in bondage free. When He finished reading the passage Jesus sat down and told the men that this prophecy had been fulfilled in their midst. The liberation of the world began that day. Jesus unleashed through His loving message of redemption; the power and principles that would bring the golden thread of liberty to the nations. From here we see the clear paper trail of liberty from the blood bought freedom documents that eminated from the Magna Carta; English Bill of rights; Mayflower compact; to our Declaration of Independence and Constitution. Political; economic and religious liberty have never been realized until the Pilgrim fathers applied the principles of the Bible fully to civil law. We can restore freedom and prosperity in our nation; only if we voluntary return to those ??eternal principles of right??; those laws given at Mount Sinai and hold our representatives accountable to limit their jurisdiction to the protection of our God-given rights; not the limitation or interpretation of them. Thoughout this course we will take you on a journey of mans battle for freedom; and we will see Gods hand in all of it.,Appropriate for all,?

Even as Pop; Minimal and Concept artists renounced the handmade work of art; a small group of women recognized the subversive value of handicraft in an age of industrial manufacturing and in an art world dominated by male artists and critics who sought theoretical purity. During her short career; Eva Hesse resituated the ancient question of how to meaningfully represent the human body and unleashed decades of experimentation that continues to this day. Judy Chicago; Linda Benglis; Jackie Windsor; Faith Ringgold; and others used the lowly status of craft and its historical association with female artisans to contrast with “high art.” By focusing of the act of making; on process and craft; these women began the process of fracturing Modernism’s reductive and largely male narratives.,Appropriate for all,?

Are you always worrying about life; money; family; or even your health? Do you wake up at around 4am in the morning and then struggle to get back to sleep? Is the merry-go-round of thought in your head; seemingly non-stop? Is your stress affecting your health; your relationships; your career or even your loved ones? Why won’t any of the ‘other’ stress remedies out there help you? What can be done to stop you feeling stressed forever? My name is Damian Mark Smyth; and I am a stress management coach. I am also a teacher and trainer in a field of modern psychology called the ‘Three Principles’. This area of prevention has been proven to work with even the most extreme cases (including in maximum security prisons) and it will give you the freedom you require from stress forever. I should know. I recently went through a divorce and custody battle and came through it completely unscathed. In fact; people were often saying to me how impossibly calm I was throughout the whole thing. You too can learn the secrets about stress that will change your life around so you will no longer have to live with the constant fear; worry and anxiety. You too will be stress-free in 7 days. This course is designed to give you the understanding behind the human operating system and to show you how the process works. As with anything else; once you have an understanding of how a system works; it’s a darn sight easier to then correct it. Think about your car. If you know how it’s put together and functions; it’s a lot easier to fix it when it goes haywire. There are no catches; no tricks; no hidden surprises... all of the ideas in this course are simple to follow and even easier to put into practice. In fact; there is a great deal of ‘doing nothing’ involved. And there’s a very good reason for this: When we listen through what we know; we limit ourselves to what we already know. So I will be asking you to leave what you already know ‘at the door’ before you enter. The reason this programme works and is life changing is BECAUSE it’s different to what you already know. That’s got you to where you are right now - without a solution. This programme IS the solution.  So get ready for a life changing seven days; as we get you stress free forever! All the modules in this programme come with an audio download; along with the written version; which means you have the choice of how to use the material.  Either way; the course is interactive; so please provide answers to the questions at the bottom of the module. This will help me tailor the understanding that you will be getting to your personal requirements and answer any queries you may have. It will also help me to get a better idea of who you are and how to achieve stress free success quickly and efficiently. The approach outlined within this course is very different to other; more traditional  stress management  programs. Therefore it is likely that you will have insights and queries that may well need addressing by me - this is an online coaching course as much as an instructional process.,Appropriate for all,?

Without a clear sense of where one is going; and an understanding of how to organize people; resources; and money to get a business off the ground; nothing happens. Nothing. Vision is important. But vision isn’t enough. It’s the entrepreneur’s responsibility to establish and execute business strategy with energy. Creating Your Business Strategy – Failure to Plan Means You Plan to Fail will equip students with the skills they need to create a business plan for a business of their choosing. Lessons from the previous three modules will be integrated into this “Capstone” session. You will learn how to take what you have learned in previous modules and apply it to creating a business strategy for a company you wish to start. Creating Your Business Strategy – Failure to Plan Means You Plan to Fail will help you to identify your Unique Value Proposition; understand your own Competitive Competency; and master the Four Keys of a Business Strategy. This course is divided into eight sessions. The first session; Introduction; is designed to explain who can benefit by taking this course; and how you can use the material to enhance sales in your business Lesson 1: Introduction to Servant Salesmanship Lesson 2: Course Outline and Syllabus The second session; Failure to Plan Means You Plan to Fail;takes the various skills you’ve been developing by examining the book publishing industry and applies them to the business you want to start. We’ll start to put the pieces together as we talk about the various types of business models you might consider; the impact of the Internet on business marketing; and the importance of completing a business plan. We’ll also discuss how to identify trends affecting your business; and the importance of industry market research. In the third session; Building a Plan for your Business helps you develop a sense of perspective. Look at the business you hope to launch. What are the market conditions facing it? What does it take to succeed in that market? Why do businesses fail? You must understand the answers to these questions; because only then can you develop a vision for your business that is sound; has a firm foundation; and sees things as they really are; not as you hope they might be. The fourth session; Identifying a Strategy for Your Business; builds on the previous sessions and turns the focus outward toward the marketplace in you compete. We’ll focus on the four keys to creating a successful business strategy. And; we’ll examine how you can answer the Three Customer Questions: HOW you’ll market your product; to WHOM you will market your product; and WHERE your customers will look when they want to find your product. In the fifth session; Evaluating the Strengths and Weaknesses of Your Business; examines the steps needed in going to “the other side of the hill.” A key element in developing strategy is that one must be realistic. We must not only understand what we’re good at; but what we’re NOT good at. In this lesson; we will examine ways to evaluate our business strengths and weaknesses to better understand how to create a strategy that gets us to where we want to go; metaphorically; to go to “The Other Side of the Hill.” In the sixth session; Implementing Your Strategic Plan; we’ll examine why knowing what is happening in YOUR industry; what trends should you pay attention to; and the threats that exist that could impact your business is critically important. In this lesson; we’ll show you how to assess the competitive forces that affect your industry and your company. We’ll help you learn how to research industry trends. In the seventh session; Developing a Consumer-Centric Marketing Strategy; we’ll examine the traditional marketing focuses on the Four Ps; which can be summarized as follows: Putting the right product in the right place; at the right price; at just the right time to promote it. Based on what you know of the external environment and the industry in which you operate; what are some of the elements of the Four Ps you would employ in marketing your service one on one? In a physical store/office? Online? Via radio; print; TV or youtube?

This course covers the music of Elvis Presley; Chuck Berry; Phil Spector; Bob Dylan; the Beatles; the Rolling Stones; Jimi Hendrix; Cream; and many more artists; with an emphasis both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how developments in the music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed.  Rock emerged in the mid 1950s as a blending of mainstream pop; rhythm and blues; and country and western--styles that previously had remained relatively separate. This new style became the music of the emerging youth culture and was often associated with teen rebellion. We will follow the story of how this rowdy first wave of rock and roll (1955-59) was tamed in the early 60s but came roaring back with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and then went psychedelic by the end of the decade.,Appropriate for all,?

In 1962; Graham laid out a brilliant and unprecedented concrete formula and strategy for investing in growth stocks in his book; Security Analysis. That chapter disappeared in later editions of the book; but money manager Fredrick Martin; has used Graham’s formula and strategy in buying stocks with great success; earning an average annual return of more than 16 percent over a 30-year period.

These very short facial expressions belong to the most reliable signs of what somebody really feels. This course has been developed by Patryk Wezowski & Kasia Wezowski; the Founders of the Center for Body Language; the World s #1 Body Language Training for Business. Why should everybody Master Reading Micro Expressions? You will Increase your Emotional Intelligence with an average of 10% (See our presentation at Harvard University) Who can read Micro Expressions well; sells 20% more products (See our research in companies) You can Predict Your Success or Failure (See our live demo in front of 2500 people) What will you learn? You ll know exactly how to recognise the 26 most common variations of 7 emotions. The average result people achieve when doing the Micro Expressions Test is 24.09% (based on 2;664 unique tests done between June-November 2012). Less then 12% are able to score above 50%. This means that most people give very little attention to facial expressions; while those tiny movements reliable sources to detect true feelings or lies. Your score can increase easily up to an average of 89.45% after following training. At their presentation at Harvard University in June 2013; Patryk & Kasia Wezowski showed the results of their research in Emotional Intelligence. Every single person who learned to read facial expressions accurately increased their Emotional Intelligence (measured with the most resilient MSCEIT Test) with an average of 10% after 4 hours of training. Your facial expressions can also predict your failure or success. Patryk & Kasia Wezowski used facial recognition to predict the outcome of the US presidential election in 2012. They measured the voters’ emotions during the presidential election; by using webcams recognizing facial expressions of people watching the candidates’ speeches. Two weeks before voters voted; they published in the media that the race would be close; but that Obama would win. He did. So the key to improve sales and to be able to detect lies in business conversations starts with being able to read non-verbal communication accurately. Who created this course? This course has been developed by Patryk Wezowski & Kasia Wezowski; the Founders of the Center for Body Language; the World s #1 Body Language Training for Business.

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,How to Teach Online 24/7/365; Udemy; online Education courses,N/A,Online Course - How to Teach Online 24/7/365,Udemy,$29,2.5 hours,Yes,David Lantz,Introduction A survey conducted by the Babson Survey Research Group regarding online learning showed that the number of students enrolled in one or more online courses was nearly 7 million in 2011.  This was more than a half million increase over 2010. At the college level; 32 percent of students are taking at least one online course. As online education literally explodes; the issue facing the education system is that teaching online is not the same as teaching face to face.  If you’re a teacher; be it home school; public school; Bible study teacher; or someone who teaches a special skill or subject; you know this.  The question for many people wishing to transition to teaching in a virtual classroom is a very simple one:  How do I do an effective job of teaching online? That’s the question this course is designed to answer.  In this course; University of Phoenix Advanced Certified Online Instructor David Lantz walks you through the teaching strategies being used by the best online college instructors to teach in an asynchronous online course.  Lesson Materials A total of 17 video lessons divided between 3 course modules constitute the core of the learning materials.  These videos are recorded power point presentations converted to video designed to emphasize key learning objectives.   Additionally; each module is accompanied by an ebook (PDF) designed to round out the video presentations.  Each module is introduced and concluded by a video of the course creator; David Lantz. A fourth module; Next Steps; concludes the course; and offers several other resources the student may wish to take advantage of. Depending on the pace of the online learner; one should plan to spend about four hours going through the materials.   Course Organization The course is divided into three modules. The first module; Creating a Culture of Self- Discipline Online; is designed to help you learn how to motivate your students to develop the self-discipline required to learn in the online environment.  This module is; in turn subdivided into three parts. ·  Learning Modality and Student Motivation ·  Establishing Participation Expectations ·  Building an Online Community The second module; Managing the Online Classroom; recognizes that online facilitation involves three basic areas of focus: organizational; social; and intellectual.  The instructor; therefore; should see his or her role as being that as a facilitator of online learning; rather than simply the “Sage on the Stage.”  This module is also subdivided into three parts. ·  Socratic Teaching: How to Teach by Asking Questions ·  It’s ALL About What you Say and How You Say It  ·  Online Interaction: Best Practices The third module; Preparing to Teach in the Flipped Classroom; examines the trend of having the student access the “lecture” via video/online instruction created by the instructor or another educator before coming to a face to face class. The role of the classroom teacher changes from Lecturer to Mentor.  Rather than spending time teaching in class; the instructor uses learning-based activities.  Doing this effectively requires the teacher to put a lot of effort into his/her course preparation up front.  This module delivers the following three sessions:  ·  Enabling Your Students to Learn 24/7/365 ·  Creating Your On Demand Unidirectional Materials  ·  Exploring an Asynchronous Learning Management Classroom. Why Take This Course The explosion in online learning requires educators who know how to teach online.  Key research findings about student learning in the online classroom underscore the importance of having instructors who can manage the online classroom to insure that students learn.   Online facilitation involves three basic areas of focus: organizational; social; and intellectual.  How to Teach in the Online Classroom 24/7/365 covers all three of these aspects of online instruction to prepare you to teach online. About David Lantz Hello; my name is David Lantz.  I’ve been teaching online at the college level since 2004.  I was voted Faculty of the Year by the first graduating class of the Indianapolis Campus of the University of Phoenix.  In May of 2012; I was awarded that school’s Advanced Facilitator Certification.  In addition to teaching online for University of Phoenix; I teach for 3 other schools on such subjects as statistics; economics; ecommerce; and public relations.  Five years ago; I set about the process of showing others how to teach online.  I worked with my first pilot group of 8 students over a four week period to demonstrate best practice techniques for online; asynchronous teaching.  With Udemy’s powerful online course delivery system; I now have a way to take what we did in that prototype class and demonstrate the art of online instruction via video and downloadable text instruction.  Welcome to my course!,Appropriate for all,?

We start by reviewing the most common shopping cart systems used on WordPress websites. We explore when you should choose a WordPress shopping cart plugin (such as WooCommerce) and when you would choose another type of cart (such as; a hosted cart solution). Then we discuss various WordPress cart plugins; leading up to a thorough review and demonstration of the recommended solution; WooCommerce. Then we proceed towards mastery of WooCommerce; as follows: The Quick Start Section shows you all the basics: shop page layouts and shortcodes; adding products and images; the checkout process for digital downloads and shippable products; PayPal configuration; and more. We also discuss the themes that will work best. The Reference Section goes into more detail; including the advanced products types & shipping methods; taxes and tax classes; coupons; order & inventory management; product reviews and more. And finally the WooCommerce Styling and Programming Section provides more advanced information (some of it for programmers; but presented for a non-programming audience) on creating your own email templates; working with Actions and Hooks; and CSS styling of your site. This is the most comprehensive; impactful and to-the-point WordPress eCommerce course on the web. Why? Because: We only show you what you need to know. WooCommerce leads the other WordPress shopping carts by a wide margin. There is rarely any need to choose another shopping cart plugin (except for simple PayPal sites; which we cover as well). So why waste your time? The videos are quite comprehensive -- for instance we show you the exact steps to take to configure PayPal to properly accept your digital download orders. Our professionally-produced videos get to the point. We will save you hours of research and trial & error. This is one of WP Academy s most recent and best courses. We hope you enjoy it.

Images and videos are everywhere; from those we take with our mobile devices and share with our friends to those that we receive from Mars and the ones we see in the movie theatre; without forgetting the whole ensemble of images of our bodies that are taken in hospital visits. Image and video processing is the art of working with such images and movies; from making it possible to store and transmit them to making those dark and blurry images look nice; as well as interpreting and analyzing the medical data and recognizing our friends’ faces in social pictures. This discipline is also fascinating because it uses tools from many areas of applied mathematics. In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing; from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms. The course will start with an introduction to the basics of image formation and the fundamental concepts that translate a physical scene into a digital image. We will then describe the underlying concepts of image compression; the enabling technology that makes it possible for images to be sent from Mars and videos to be stored in our mobile phones. We will cover the most fundamental tools in image enhancement; showing how simple tools can significantly improve images. Both geometric and non-geometric tools as well as spatial and non-spatial operations will be presented. Details on image segmentation will be provided; one of the most fundamental and useful problems in image processing. The above topics will be extended to color images and video. Once we have covered the fundamentals; which both provide the basis for modern image and video processing and serve many important applications until today; we will move into recent progress in the area; covering image inpainting (how to remove objects from images and video); image processing via sparse modeling and compressed sensing; geometric partial differential equations for image analysis; image processing for HIV and virus research; and image processing for neurosurgery and other medical applications.,Appropriate for all,?
