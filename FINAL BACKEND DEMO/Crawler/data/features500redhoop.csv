We do not have to worry of major nuclear wars; and then; no longer can we anticipate stability based on nuclear deterrence. We have no immediate threat emanating from a belligerent adversary equipped with a major arsenal; but we observe a number of small to medium military powers that are more belligerent than the days of the Soviet Union. We have more democracies in the world; and yet are far from the democratic peace that has been imagined by the students of international relations. This course aims to nail down some of the basic issues that had been argued in the current research on peace and security. The questions are all deceptively simple enough; but then the answers will all be ambiguous at best. It is my hope that you will be able to provide better answers than those given in the course by developing your own analytical capacity.,Appropriate for all,?

Topics covered include plotting; stochastic programs; probability and statistics; random walks; Monte Carlo simulations; modeling data; optimization problems; and clustering. What will I learn? If you successfully complete this course; you will have: Developed some insight into the process of moving from an ambiguous problem statement to a computational formulation of a method for solving the problem; Learned a useful set of algorithmic and problem reduction techniques; Learned how to use simulations to shed light on problems that don’t easily succumb to closed form solutions; Learned how to use computational tools; including simple statistical; machine learning; and plotting tools; to model and understand data.

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Financing and Investing in Infrastructure; Coursera; online Business courses,N/A,Online Course - Financing and Investing in Infrastructure,Coursera,Free,6 weeks,Yes,N/A,According to the OECD; the total global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for transport; electricity generation; transmission and distribution; water and telecommunications comes to $71tn. This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030. The European Commission estimated that; by 2020; Europe will need between euro 1.5tn and euro 2tn of infrastructure investments. In the time period between 2011 and 2020; about euro 500bn will be required for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) programme; euro 400bn for Energy distribution networks and smart grids; euro 200 bn on Energy transmission networks and storage and euro 500bn for the upgrade and construction of new power plants. An additional euro 38-58bn and euro 181-268bn capital investment will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion. Traditionally; investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However; severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. The course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoints of equity; debt and hybrid instruments. The course is concentrated on the practical aspects of project finance; the most frequently used financial technique for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies allows students to link the theoretical background to actual business practice. At the end of the course; students will be in the position to analyze a complex transaction; to identify key elements of the deal and to suggest proper solutions for deal structuring from the perspective of a financial advisor.,Appropriate for all,?

These were not just the official institutions of art; they were; in essence; the only institutions available for living artists to train and to make their work known. This tutorial looks at a crucial moment for painting; on the eve of the Revolution of 1848.

Enroll NOW! In this course; we teach easy-to-incorporate legal principles. The term corporation comes from the Latin corpus; which means body. A corporation is a body--it is a legal person in the eyes of the law. It can bring lawsuits; can buy and sell property; contract; be taxed; and even commit crimes. It s most notable feature: a corporation protects its owners from personal liability for corporate debts and obligations--within limits. The corporation is considered an artificially created legal entity that exists separate and apart from those individuals who created it and carry on its operations. With as little as one incorporator; a corporation can be formed by simply filing an application for a charter with the respective state. By filing this application; the incorporator will put on record facts; such as: the purpose of the intended corporation; the names and addresses of the incorporators; the amount and types of capital stock the corporation will be authorized to issue; and the rights and privileges of the holders of each class of stock. Advantages of Incorporating Owners are protected from personal liability fro company debts and obligations. Corporations have a reliable body of legal precedent to guide owners and managers. Corporations are the best vehicle for eventual public companies. Corporations can more easily raise capital through the sale of securities. Corporations can easily transfer ownership through the transfer of securities. Corporations can have an unlimited life. Corporations can create tax benefits under certain circumstances; but note that C corporations may be subject to  double taxation  on profits. To avoid this; many business owners elect to operate their corporations under subchapter S of the Internal Code. Also known as an S corporation; this entity allows income to pass through to the individual shareholders. Get expert legal incorporation training in this course.,Appropriate for all,?

However; you may prefer to think of an email list as a marketing tool that creates a relationship with your potential customers.  An email list is a business asset  If you aren’t building an email list; you’re missing out on the most powerful and consistent way to drive repeat visitors and customers to your website or blog.  – Corbett Barr from ThinkTraffic.net.  I ll explain the importance of thinking of your email list as a collection of people rather than a collection of email addresses or – even worse – a way to make money.  I ll recommend you don t constantly send sales emails.  I ll tell you about the importance of an offer and how often and how much you should give away for free I ll  explain about incentives and lead magnets. I ll introduce the squeeze page and show you how to make one I ll show you the best ways to create signup forms and where to put them on your website I ll explain about the  Thank You  page and the  Welcome  page. The process of collecting email addresses and bulk-emailing out to them in a way that by-passes the spam filters and stays on the right side of the CAN-SPAM act is phenomenally complicated.  That s why I ll show you step by step instructions of exactly how to use the powerful tools of two of the foremost email marketing services: Aweber and Mailchimp.  I ll also show you about email messages – the different types you can send; how to send them; when to send them and the best ways of writing effective emails to drive traffic and sales. Many online businesses focus; incorrectly sometimes; on social media; whereas Email Marketing provides a much better return on your investment.   If they’re liking the content you’re sending them regularly; then there’s a good chance they’re going to like the products you create. Email subscribers are more likely to buy your products than any other type of audience.” – Glen Allsopp from ViperChill.com.

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Buddhism and Modern Psychology ; Coursera; online Humanities courses,N/A,Online Course - Buddhism and Modern Psychology,Coursera,Free,6 weeks,Yes,N/A,The Dalai Lama has said that Buddhism and science are deeply compatible and has encouraged Western scholars to critically examine both the meditative practice and Buddhist ideas about the human mind. A number of scientists and philosophers have taken up this challenge. There have been brain scans of meditators and philosophical examinations of Buddhist doctrines. There have even been discussions of Darwin and the Buddha: Do early Buddhist descriptions of the mind; and of the human condition; make particular sense in light of evolutionary psychology?  This course will examine how Buddhism is faring under this scrutiny. Are neuroscientists starting to understand how meditation “works”? Would such an understanding validate meditation—or might physical explanations of meditation undermine the spiritual significance attributed to it? And how are some of the basic Buddhist claims about the human mind holding up? We’ll pay special attention to some highly counterintuitive doctrines: that the self doesn’t exist; and that much of perceived reality is in some sense illusory. Do these claims; radical as they sound; make a certain kind of sense in light of modern psychology? And what are the implications of all this for how we should live our lives? Can meditation make us not just happier; but better people?,Appropriate for all,?

For many years; my company website was like most other business websites; only getting a dribble of traffic and it certainly wasn’t generating leads and new customers. I thought that a new design would change things; but I know now that was just silly (I explain why in the course). So I started researching on How to Do Online Marketing; doing courses; listening to internet “gurus”.  There are many people out there promoting instant internet riches but I didn’t feel comfortable using some of their tactics.  I already had a well established brand and authority amongst our clients – the business had already been running for 30 years. I tried many different ideas. I abandoned the ones that didn’t (there were many) and focused on the ones that did. The strategy outlined in this course is not about instant riches or tricks in beating Google.  It is about:</p> building authority & trust amongst your clients; prospects and industry; communicating with all your clients and prospects on a regular basis with valuable; relevant information; having people finding and contacting you when they have a problem that you can solve; rather than you trying to find them. a constant stream of new leads; prospects and customers for your business. I put this course to help my clients on How to Do Online Marketing;; who were spending thousands on new websites but having no idea what to do with it after it was made.  It is like buying a car but not knowing how to drive.  This course shows you how to drive; it provides a roadmap for you to follow.</p>,Appropriate for all,?

Schmidt,The confluence of multi-core and distributed-core processors; inexpensive mass storage; ubiquitous wireless connectivity; and commodity software platforms is driving the need for software engineers and programmers who understand how to develop concurrent and networked software for mobile devices that connect to cloud computing platforms. Despite many improvements in processors; storage; and networks; however; developing quality software on-time and on-budget remains hard. Moreover; developing high quality reusable concurrent and networked software apps and services is even harder.  The principles; methods; and skills required to develop such software are best learned by attaining mastery of patterns; pattern languages; and frameworks. A pattern describes a reusable solution to a common problem that arises within a particular context. When related patterns are woven together they form a pattern language that defines a vocabulary and a process for the orderly resolution of software development problems. A framework is an integrated set of components that collaborate to provide a reusable architecture for a family of related apps or services.  Frameworks can also be viewed as concrete realizations of pattern languages that facilitate direct reuse of detailed design and source code. This MOOC describes by example how to apply patterns; pattern languages; and frameworks to alleviate the complexity of developing concurrent and networked software for mobile devices via the use of object-oriented design techniques; Javaprogramming language features; and Android middleware. An extended case study project will be used throughout the MOOC to showcase pattern-oriented software design and programming techniques for concurrent and networked mobile devices and clouds. Note: This course is part of a trans-institution sequence of MOOCs entitled Mobile Cloud Computing with Android This MOOC and two others; taught by Dr. Adam Porter from the University of Maryland and Dr. Jules White from Vanderbilt University; have been designed to complement each other as part of the first trans-institution sequence of MOOCs taught on the Coursera platform; structured as follows: The University of Maryland MOOC; Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems; will start on January 21st; 2014. It focuses on the design and programming of user-facing applications.   The first Vanderbilt MOOC in the sequence; Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems; will start on April 2nd. It focuses on middleware systems programming topics; such as synchronous and asynchronous concurrency models; background service processing; structured data management; local inter-process communication and networking; and integration with cloud-based services.   The second Vanderbilt MOOC in the sequence; Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems; will be start on June 15th; 2014. It focuses on how to connect Android mobile devices to cloud computing and data storage resources; essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms; such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2. Some of the programming assignments and the course project for these MOOCs will be coordinated.  If you just want to take some of the MOOCs in this sequence or take them all in different order you’re certainly welcome to do so; and you’ll still learn a lot. However; if you take all the MOOCs in this sequence in the order presented you’ll gain a deeper; end-to-end understanding of handheld systems; their applications and services; as well as their integration into the cloud.,Appropriate for all,?

We explain the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. We present declarative dataflow; the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming; and show how it avoids race conditions. We give a simple formal semantics for all concepts and illustrate them with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform; the Mozart Programming System. This course is targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students; but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.

Stark,Statistics 2 at Berkeley is an introductory class taken by about 1;000 students each year. Stat2.3x is the last in a sequence of three courses that make up Stat2x; the online equivalent of Berkeley s Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.3x is on statistical inference: how to make valid conclusions based on data from random samples. At the heart of the main problem addressed by the course will be a population (which you can imagine for now as a set of people) connected with which there is a numerical quantity of interest (which you can imagine for now as the average number of MOOCs the people have taken). If you could talk to each member of the population; you could calculate that number exactly. But what if the population is so large that your resources will not stretch to interviewing every member? What if you can only reach a subset of the population? Stat 2.3x will discuss good ways to select the subset (yes; at random); how to estimate the numerical quantity of interest; based on what you see in your sample; and ways to test hypotheses about numerical or probabilistic aspects of the problem. The methods that will be covered are among the most commonly used of all statistical techniques. If you have ever read an article that claimed;  The margin of error in such surveys is about three percentage points;  or;  Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have discovered a highly significant link between ...;  then you should expect that by the end of Stat 2.3x you will have a pretty good idea of what that means. Examples will range all the way from a little girl s school science project (seriously – she did a great job and her results were published in a major journal) to rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court. The fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout the course; the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations; the assumptions under which they are valid; and the correct interpretation of results.,Appropriate for all,?

In this course you will study the first 20 Kanji and learn 139 of 530 compounds. A compound is when you take a Kanji character and combine it with another Kanji character. This is the way to really build your vocabulary. For example; we ll take the single Kanji for 9 ? and combine it with the single Kanji for month ? to form September which is ??. The video format of this course provides a convenient way to review the Kanji over and over again. However; there will also be a great deal of reviewing as we go along. The course format relies heavily on building and repetition. Each lesson except for lesson 1 includes a quiz and a review of the previous lessons. In the section called;  What have we learned so far?  The kanji from the previous lessons will be presented in a slideshow in random order. This will allow you to review everything you ve studied before proceeding to the next lesson. Take pride in learning to read long and short sentences and Have fun becoming literate in Japanese. An Article by the creator of this course on how to start studying Japanese Kanji and a resource list are posted below. How to start Studying Japanese Kanji Studying Japanese Kanji can be a little bit scary; especially if your first language is English where you only have to learn 26 letters.Up until a few years ago; the standard for Japanese literacy was the Joyo Kanji; a list of 1945 essential use Kanji that had to be learned before graduating from a Japanese High School. Foreigners who could read those 1945 Kanji were considered literate in Japanese.Recently the number of Joyo Kanji has increased from 1945 to 2136.Foreigners who want to be as literate in Japanese as a High School graduate will need to master 2136 Kanji. At first glance; memorizing 2136 individual Kanji pictographs may seem a little daunting and because the number 2136 is a little scary; foreigners living and working in Japan or just interested in Japanese culture sometimes put off studying Kanji for years.Another obstacle is that if it’s not possible for you to travel to Japan to study Japanese at a Japanese language school; Japanese self-study can be a little bit intimidating.However; with the right tools it is possible to learn Japanese Kanji. These 5 Kanji study techniques will help you to begin reading Japanese today. Kanji study technique #1. The first step is to remove the fear of memorizing2136 separate Kanji characters.One of the best tools for eliminating this fear is a book called “Remembering the Kanji” by James Heisig.The first 125 pages of Remembering the Kanji are available online at the Remembering the Kanji website. In this book Mr. Heisig breaks Kanji down into separate parts called radicals.Several Kanji lists identify 214 radicals. So before you try to memorize 2136 characters; it’s a good idea to memorize those 214 radicals first.214 is a lot easier than 2136.Here is a quick demonstration of how Kanji radicals work.After you’ve memorized the radical which means woman?and the radical which means child ?; when you see ??? in a sentence; it will not be so scary and you’ll know that it means baby girl or female child (Onna no ko).This technique is also a good way to learn a lot of compounds. Compounds are Kanji combinations that form words.For example; after you’ve learned that the Kanji for mountain?is yama and the Kanji for mouth of opening is kuchi ? or ~guchi; it will be very easy to read the Japanese last name Yamaguchi??. Kanji study technique #2. The next step when memorizing Kanji is to have a goal or a list of Kanji that you’d like to learn.An easy goal that you can start right now is to learn the Kanji characters for the Kanji numbers from1 to 10. It’s extremely easy; especially considering that 1 is ?; 2 is?and three is?.So you really only have to learn the characters from 4 to 10. Kanji study technique #3 Some Kanji students like to study Kanji in the same order that Japanese students learn them.Each year more kanji are added until all 2136 have been covered.In a Japanese Elementary school; in Grade 1; you would learn 80 Kanji; Grade 2:160 Kanji; Grade 3:200 Kanji; Grade 4:200; Grade 5:185 and Grade 6:181.Over the course of High School; you would learn the additional 1; 130 Kanji. If you live in Japan; have a child going through school in Japan; or have access to the graded texts used in Japanese schools; this is a good structured way to work towards fluency. Kanji study technique #4 Another Goal; a lot of Kanji students have is the JLPT (Japanese Language proficiency test). The JLPT is a standardized test that can be taken each year which covers reading Kanji; grammar; vocabulary and listening. There are 5 Levels; JLPT N5; JLPT N4; JLPT N3; JLPT N2 and JLPT N1. In the past; there were only four levels but a new level JLPT N5 has recently been created. Level N4 has been split into N5 and N4 and the N5 Kanji list includes the 80 Kanji that Grade 1 Japanese students learn which are called the????ichinensei Kanji. JLPT exams are held every year in cities across the world.In the past; the JLPT association provided a Kanji list and students would be able to study from a list of Kanji that would be on the test. This made JLPT test preparation a little easier.The JLPT has since amended its policy in the interest of creating more well-rounded students; not simply students that have memorized a list.The JLPT association recommends several Kanji texts on their website. Kanji study technique #5 For beginners who are new to Kanji; textbooks that are filled entirely with Japanese only and have no Kanji to English or Kanji to Romaji translation can be a little discouraging. The online Japanese course “Learn 80 JLPT N5 Kanji and 530 Japanese compounds” takes away a little bit of the fear of reading a textbook that is entirely in Japanese.The course provides a video slideshow of the Kanji radicals you need to learn;short videos of the Kanji being drawn before the lesson; on yomi and Kun yomi Kanji readings; a list of the Kanji readings in English; hiragana and Romaji and example sentences for each Kanji. Since the way Japanese people learn Kanji themselves is by years and years of having to draw the Kanji over and over; the course mimics the repetition available in a Japanese elementary school or High School; by short videos that can be watched repeatedly instead of a bulky textbook.Constant quizzing and review after each lesson also mimics the repetitive environment of a Japanese school until all 530 Kanji have been mastered. The bottomline is this: Kanji is not impossible. All that is needed is a plan and the right resources.A list of resources is provided below and with determination and patience; everyone can learn how to read Japanese Kanji.

This course will help you learn about life in the ocean; how ocean ecosystems function; how scientists study the ocean; and the challenges we face in sustaining healthy oceans for the future. These topics will be explored using case studies that focus on charismatic marine megafauna species – the most compelling creatures in the ocean that capture our attention and inspire us to learn more. The course starts with an examination of the physical dimensions of the world’s ocean and how we describe ocean zones based on the ecosystems found within them. Once these basics are covered; we will work through the evolution of life in the oceans and explore how marine animals have adapted to the challenges of a cold; dark and deep ocean. Throughout the class we will highlight how scientists study the oceans and the animals that live in them; providing glimpses of new technologies that boost our understanding of marine ecology. The course will also cover some of the challenges the oceans face due to human activities - exploring issues such as bycatch and climate change - and how they are affecting ocean species and systems. Throughout the course we will connect with real marine science through the use of open access scientific articles published in the journal PLOS ONE. This means you will have to learn how to read scientific papers and extract the important bits of information from them. The articles you’ll be reading are all part of a new PLOS Collection focused on using open access research to teach marine science and conservation. You will also get to look at real datasets produced by scientists studying marine creatures and visualize them in freely available programs such as Google Earth.,Appropriate for all,?

What are the economics of email spam? How does Google find what you re looking for... and exactly how do they make money doing so? Networked Life looks at how our world is connected -- socially; strategically and technologically -- and why it matters. The answers to the questions above are related. They have been the subject of a fascinating intersection of disciplines; including computer science; physics; psychology; sociology; mathematics; economics and finance. Researchers from these areas all strive to quantify and explain the growing complexity and connectivity of the world around us; and they have begun to develop a rich new science along the way. Networked Life will explore recent scientific efforts to explain social; economic and technological structures -- and the way these structures interact -- on many different scales; from the behavior of individuals or small groups to that of complex networks such as the Internet and the global economy. This course covers computer science topics and other material that is mathematical; but all material will be presented in a way that is accessible to an educated audience with or without a strong technical background. The majority of the course is grounded in scientific and mathematical findings of the past two decades or less (often much less).

What Should I Know? This class assumes an understanding of programming at the level of CS101; including the ability to read and write short programs in Python; it also assumes a comfort level with mathematical notation at the level of high school Algebra II or the SATs. Syllabus Lesson 1: A Social Network Magic Trick Becoming familiar with algorithm analysis Lesson 2: Growth Rates in Social Networks Using mathematical tools to analyze how things are connected Lesson 3: Basic Graph Algorithms Finding the quickest route to Kevin Bacon Lesson 4: It’s Who You Know Keeping track of your best friends using heaps Lesson 5: Strong and Weak Bonds Working with social networks with edge weights.

Take a look at the “Class Summary;” “What Should I Know;” and “What Will I Learn” sections above. If you want to know more; just enroll in the course and start exploring. Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something; feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you’re confused; you can always go back and watch something that you skipped. How much does this cost? It’s completely free! If you’re feeling generous; we would love to have you contribute your thoughts; questions; and answers to the course discussion forum. What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning; not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking; to check your understanding; for fun; etc... But really; they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence; so try not to let them stress you out. What should I do while I’m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes; draw diagrams; make notecards; and actively try to make sense of the material.,Intermediate,?

Biostatistics is about quantitative approaches - ideas and skills - to address bioscience and health problems. To achieve mastery of biostatistics skills; a student must “see one; do one; teach one.” Therefore; the course is organized to promote regular practice of new ideas and methods. The course is organized into 3 self-contained modules. Each module except the first is built around an important health problem. The first module reviews the scientific method and the role of experimentation and observation to generate data; or evidence; relevant to selecting among competing hypotheses about the natural world. Bayes theorem is used to quantify the concept of evidence. Then; we will discuss what is meant by the notion of “cause.”   In the second module; we use a national survey dataset to estimate the costs of smoking and smoking-caused disease in American society. The concepts of point and interval estimation are introduced. Students will master the use of confidence intervals to draw inferences about population means and differences of means. They will use stratification and weighted averages to compare subgroups that are otherwise similar in an attempt to estimate the effects of smoking and smoking-caused diseases on medical expenditures. In the final module; we will study what factors influence child-survival in Nepal using data from the Nepal Nutritional Intervention Study Sarlahi or NNIPPS. Students will estimate and obtain confidence intervals for infant survival rates; relative rates and odds ratios within strata defined by gestational period; singleton vs twin births; and parental characteristics.,Appropriate for all,?

As the head of a media department responsible for creating commercial advertisements and other videos; he had legitimate production skills. He was also ready and willing to devote all his waking time and money to a side project. But into his fifth year of making his first feature-length movie; 95ers; Tom realized he might be in over his head. This sci-fi epic required a full crew; not to mention elaborate sets; miniatures; and intense visual effects and compositing work. Just when it seemed like he might never be able to release a complete version of the movie; he turned to Kickstarter. There he found an unexpected outpouring of financial support and an entirely new audience for his film.

Alcanzar retos profesionales como entrenador de fútbol u otros Deportes y liderar equipos aportando valor añadido y diferenciador: Desarrollar la capacidad para Movilizar a todo el equipo en la dirección que marquen los objetivos. Para los que aún no conocen una definición clara de Coaching Deportivo; se define como  “un proceso de entrenamiento-aprendizaje; que consiste en despertar el talento dormido y los recursos internos del deportista; entrenador y/o directivo para incrementar al máximo el rendimiento deportivo y personal; superando los obstáculos a través  de un plan de acción (cambio) con metas realistas”. (Gutiérrez y Scheele; en Conde; 2009). Para conocer la aplicación de esta herramienta; se ha estructurado el Taller en 7 secciones donde se describen las fases del entrenamiento completo. En este proceso el Coach (entrenador) entrena al Coachee (entrenado) para que logre: Tomar Conciencia: Entrenar la capacidad de autoconocimiento y ser consciente de lo que se quiere: reencuentro con las motivaciones Mantener la Actitud Positiva: Entrenar y saber cómo mejorar a través de herramientas de coaching: aprender a construir objetivos y liderar gestionando emociones Ejecutar el Plan de Acción Eficaz. Actuar mediante un plan de acción con metas realistas Para ello; cada una de las secciones se trabajarán a través de Videotutoriales que explican el contenido completo de cada area formativa; apoyandonos en las transparencias; y concluyendo cada una con una actividad práctica que servirá; además de recurso aplicado y ersonal; como anclaje de base para el desarrollo de la siguiente sección. Se trata de aprender de forma conectada; descubriendo conexiones mentales que activan los procesos cognitivos y emocionales básicos para que el aprendizaje sea significativo; sencillamente útil.
