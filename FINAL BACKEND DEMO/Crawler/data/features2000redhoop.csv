It resolves emotional eating via its four pillars—Emotional; Mental; Spiritual; and Physical—thereby leading to a total resolution of the problem. It is; without a doubt; the one and only solution you’ll ever need to overcome stress eating or emotional eating.

I want you to both learn about war; but more importantly; use it as way of understanding your everyday social world So; for example; the discussion of war and gender will serve to start you thinking about how expectations of masculinity are created and our discussion of nationalism will make clear how easy “us-them” dichotomies can be established and (ab)used. I will suggest some readings for you to complement the class and assign some activities through which you will be able to apply the theoretical insights from the course to your observations of everyday life. At the end of the course; you will start to see war everywhere and come to appreciate how much it defines our life.,Appropriate for all,?

What are the benefits of mindfulness? Monitor on Psychology; July/August 2012). Studies show evidence that mindfulness increases positive emotions and decreases negative emotions and anxiety. Farb et al.; found that mindfulness shifts a person s ability to use emotion regulation strategies; enabling them to experience emotion selectively. Farb NAS; Anderson AK; Mayberg H; et al. Minding one s emotions: Mindfulness training alters the neural expression of sadness. Emotion. 2010;10(1):25–33.

You immediately remember that your organization recently practiced its quarterly disaster preparedness exercise. You know what to do; who to contact; and the location of the alternate office to use in case of an emergency. You are concerned; but you are confident that you have a plan in place. As a key member of the organization’s crisis communication team (CMT); you know your role. You help management immediately prepare a news release and update the company’s website with factual information on the who; what; when; and where details of the event. You use social media; such as Twitter and Facebook; and traditional media; such as radio and TV; to inform internal stakeholder groups (e.g.; senior leadership; employees; and investors) and external stakeholder groups (e.g.; customers; clients; local officials; and the general public) with appropriate key messages. During times of crisis; the public relations specialist helps management communicate that sound; safe; and responsible actions are being used to protect and defend the organization from harm or damage. Crisis communication is one of the many specialized areas or functions of public relations. This course will specifically focus on the use of crisis communication to protect and defend a company or organization facing a problem or challenge that threatens to harm its brand or reputation. As a sudden and unexpected serious event; a crisis can fall into four categories: acts of God; mechanical problems; human error; and management decision or indecision. You may recall examples of crisis in news media coverage of killer earthquakes and tsunamis; grounded airplanes; stranded cruise ship passengers; and senior government officials or CEOs who are fired or asked to resign following adulterous affairs.

Harpp; Joe Schwarcz,Eating and understanding the nuances of food has become a complicated and often confusing experience. Virtually every day brings news about some “miracle food” that we should be consuming or some  poison  we should be avoiding. One day it s tomatoes to prevent cancer; then flaxseed against heart disease or soybeans for menopause. At the same time we may be warned about trans fats; genetically modified foods; aspartame or MSG. Dietary supplements may be touted as the key to health or a factor in morbidity. According to some; dairy products are indispensable while others urge us to avoid them. The same goes for meat; wheat and soy; the list goes on. This course will shed light on the molecules that constitute our macro and micro nutrients and will attempt to clarify a number of the food issues using the best science available. Other topics to be presented will include the diet-cancer relationship; the link between diet and cardiovascular disease; food-borne illnesses; food additives and weight control.,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Globalization and You; Coursera; online Business courses,N/A,Online Course - Globalization and You,Coursera,Free,10 weeks,Yes,N/A,Particular attention is paid to the ways market-led macro-economic reforms associated with globalization (such as free trade agreements and privatization initiatives) have come together with much more micro innovations in how personal behavior is organized by market forces (rethinking education as a personal investment practice; for example; or outsourcing dating to for-profit companies).  Mediating between these macro and micro scales of capitalist transformation are a wide array of other market-based mechanisms examined in the course.  From bond risk ratings to the market metrics shaping FICO scores; personalized medicine and online mapping; these market-mechanisms require close examination. Tracing their influence with an awareness of their material geographic variation and unevenness; the course offers an alternative to economistic assumptions about choice-maximizing behavior on a ‘level playing field’. It explores instead the complex uneven development dynamics of globalization in ways that allow you to see how your own personal perspectives on these dynamics are at once outcomes and enablers of economic and social change.  And; by doing so; the course aims in turn at enabling you to be a more engaged participant in the ongoing debates over the direction these dynamics should take.  Key words that are debated; defined and/or explained in the course include: globalization; interdependency; discourse; capitalism; neoliberalism; value; financialization; harmonization; competition; governance; governmentality; power; citizenship; choice; accountability; enclaving; geopolitics; biopolitics; biocapital and global health.,Appropriate for all,?

All stress isn’t bad; but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds; bodies; and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking; relaxation strategies; choosing one’s attention) and positive routines (good sleep; scheduling in fun; and so on) in order to better manage stress; bounce back quicker after a setback; be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits; develop stronger relationships with others; be physically and mentally healthy; and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short; resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life. The purpose of this course is to teach individuals the science behind becoming a resilient person. Stated simply; resilience is the ability to survive and thrive. Resiliency is not only about your ability to positively adapt in the face of adverse or challenging circumstances (that is; survive); but it is also about learning the positive skills; strategies and routines that enable you to live a happy; fulfilling; and meaningful life (in other words; thrive). This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself in order to effectively manage life stressors and do what matters most in life. This captures the notion of being from the inside out; which is a phrase that highlights the importance of promoting core resilience skills; strategies; and routines among early childhood educators. In turn; resilient people are more capable of creating and maintaining nurturing; supportive; and effective learning environments while also optimizing their own wellbeing and love for both the big and small things in life. By the end of this course; you will have learned about the knowledge and skills that you can apply in your life now and in the future to be a resilient person. Course goal: The goal for this course is to give you permission to take care of yourself and empower you to be a resilient person. A resilient person is someone who: purposely strives to be as mentally and psychically healthy as possible; possesses the confidence to effectively cope with and manage stressful situations; is compassionate towards self and others; demonstrates grit or perseverance even in the face of adversity; and focuses on the positive and fulfilling aspects of life. Course supporting objectives: When you complete this course; you will be able to: Describe why ‘functioning from the inside out’ is critical to becoming a resilient; effective person Explain the benefits of resilience and how the specific skills translate into optimizing social-emotional wellbeing and doing what matters most in life Directly practice a variety of resilience skills in different aspects of your life; including but not limited to: Mindfulness practices Strategies to manage intense emotions Activities that induce positive emotions Clarifying important personal values (that is; what matters most) and committing to behaving consistent with them Making health lifestyle choices that are cheap and readily available; yet promote well-being Describe why ‘practicing’ and integrating resilience skills into one’s life is critical to making them a habit and becoming a resilient person Develop a resilience plan that serves as a roadmap for your future,Appropriate for all,?

Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring; a bit of Edmund Spenser’s Faerie Queene; and poems by Keats; Tennyson; Browning; and others. Drawing on centuries of romance narrative conventions; the twenty-first century gaming industry has become a creative and economic powerhouse.  It engages the talents of some of our brightest writers; artists; composers; computer engineers; game theorists; video producers; and marketing professionals; and in 2012; it generated an estimated $64 billion in revenue.  Anyone interested in today’s culture needs to be conversant with the ways this new medium is altering our understanding of stories.  Join me as we set out on an intellectual adventure; the quest to discover the cultural heritage of online games.,Appropriate for all,?

Wordpress is a simple platform and is easy to use but knowing what options to use when can often lead to confusion. I am a website designer with over 13 years of experience. I have been designing websites with Wordpress for over 5 years. In 2013; I deployed over 62 customized Wordpress websites for Small Businesses and Organizations in my area. With each deployment; came the training. I provided recorded tutorials for each of my clients so they could have something to reference. That is where this course comes into play. I want you to completely understand how to use your Wordpress Website so you can get the most out of it. You either spent a lot of time setting up your website or paid somebody else to do it; so it needs to provide you value. In this course; I will walk through Wordpress section by section describing how and when to use each feature. By the end of this course you will know everything that Wordpress is capable of doing on it s own. I want your website to be a successful website and that starts with understanding how to use it. This course is free because I believe that having a good understanding of how to manage your website will result in a better internet experience for all of us. This course is for anybody who has either just setup Wordpress or was just handed login access to a website they had designed by a website designer. If you have had your Wordpress Website for a while and never got the hang of using it; this course will refresh and renew your desire to create good content and share your story with the world. Sign up today! It s free. You can use the Udemy.Com app to view the content on your smart phone or tablet which makes it easy to follow along with your browser as you watch me describe Wordpress features and best practices. Some say I am a little long winded with my explanations; however I am that way because I want all to understand. Some aspects of Wordpress are very apparent to some while others struggle with understanding how a certain feature works.

This course was first offered at Peking University in 2008 as a Public Elective Course; and subsequently as a Course for General Education. It is now being offered globally as one of Peking University’s MOOCs.  Addressing students  interests in 20th century Western Music Culture and incorporating music theory; the course examines 20th century Western music. By combining theory and practice; the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music; but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music; such as neo-classical; expressionism; nationalism and other genres; but also explores in depth jazz; rock; and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context; students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera; musicals; and film music. By enhancing students’ understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music; pop music; folk music; comprehensive art) as a foundation; three core questions will be addressed: what is music; what is the 20th century Western music; and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted; knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena; expanding students’ horizons; enhancing their ability to reason by analogy; and promoting cross-disciplinary; creative development. ???????????????????????????????????????????????20?????????????????????????????????????20??????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???20?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????20?????????????????????????????????20???????????????????20???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

Ever tried to learn tarot from books and found yourself more confused than when you began? My aim with this course is to make learning the tarot as easy as possible. The course is designed for the complete beginner but beneficial to those with some experience with the tarot. The course teaches you the skills to become a professional tarot reader but it s really up to you how far you want to take it. In the course: - I share with you 2 or 3 meanings for each card that have worked well for me; including course notes in PDF format. - Learn an easy astrological system for working with the court cards and minor arcana. - Learn 3 different layouts and create your own. - Learn how to deliver information in a professional manner. - Watch some sample readings. - I discuss important aspects of being a professional tarot reader; including; - How to protect yourself. - Ways to develop your intuition. - Charging a fee. ...and much more. One thing I hear a lot from potential students is; I feel drawn to the cards but I m not psychic... A psychic is different to a tarot reader. A tarot reader reads the cards; conveying one or more potential meanings to the client in relation to the positional meanings. You will however find that your intuition will develop. Everyone is born with the ability to be intuitive and just like a muscle it will get stronger the more you use it.

The result is possibly the most insightful; educational; and thought provoking video we ve produced so far. In this 72 minute video; you ll watch Ryan sketch out a user interface for a single page of a web application. He doesn t write any code (that comes next); but he thinks through the issues and follows several possible paths before coming to rest on a solution. You ll benefit from watching him learn about the problem domain; evaluate his own ideas; and combine user interface metaphors into a plan for a prototype. He describes his process as clearly as he thinks about it; which makes for a great video whether you re a front-end designer or a back-end programmer. First; Ryan teaches about sketching and thinking through the problem. Then Ryan implements a prototype in HTML and CSS.,Beginner,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,GERD; Udemy; online Health and Fitness courses,N/A,Online Course - GERD,Udemy,$30,1.5 hours,Yes,Veronica Waks M.D.; N.D.,Course description GERD That terrible burning in your chest and throat that you call “heartburn” may be acid reflux; or what doctors call “Gastro-Esophogeal Reflux Disease” (GERD). GERD is shockingly common disease; about 20 million Americans are affected. It can present itself with numerous symptoms; including heartburn; voice hoarseness; postnasal drip; regurgitation; nausea; stomach fullness or bloating; or a sensation that something is stuck in your esophagus. Acid reflux; acid reflux disease; esophageal reflux; GERD all have the same meaning: stomach acid and juices flow from the stomach back up into the tube that leads from the throat to the stomach (esophagus). Unfortunately; most people think that acid reflux results from an excess of acid in the stomach. A common misconception is that this abundant acid comes up into the esophagus to create the problem. This idea suggests that the solution to the acid reflux problem is to decrease acid production. This can easily be done by taking antacids. Antacids; however; may mask the symptoms and temporarily relieve the acute esophageal pain associated with acid reflux; but cannot actually fix the underlying problem. This is because the cause of heartburn; acid reflux or GERD is NOT an excess of stomach acid. Many patients come to my practice in despair; they take maximum doses of PPIs or H2 blockers and still have GERD. GERD has numerous causes and every patient should have an individual treatment plan according to the specific cause. I have never had a patient in my practice; however; whose problem stemmed from high production of stomach acid. Quite the contrary; more acid; as opposed to less; is essential in keeping Lower Esophageal Sphincter closed. By taking antacids to reduce acid levels; we are therefore potentially making the true cause of the problem far worse. As we age; we tend to produce less stomach acid; as a result the Esophageal Sphincter relaxes before our stomachs are completely emptied; causing a small amount of acid to travel to the esophagus. We need more acid to complete the digestive processes in the stomach to prevent the sphincter from opening prematurely. Why do we need more stomach acid? Acid is essential for the digestion and absorption of protein; vitamins; minerals and other beneficial nutrients. Low levels of stomach acid are directly linked to poor nutrition and a range of medical conditions including osteoporosis; pneumonia and muscular degeneration; a higher risk of infectious diseases such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. These problems often result from acid blocking medications. But your doctor will have a hard time understanding the causes of these diseases because there can be a long time lag after taking your acid blockers before these symptoms appear. Once you are diagnosed with GERD you will be prescribed PPI (Proton Pump Inhibitor) or H2-blocker; commonly prescribed drugs to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach. You may consider going for a second or third opinion to find the root of your acid reflux problem; but these opinions will all be similar because all of your doctors went to the same kind of medical school. All medical schools around the world have the same standard: GERD=PPI treatment! Naturopathic Physicians or nutritionists are more likely to offer alternative treatment ideas; because they are trained to examine the whole person and his or her entire medical history; and to resist treating symptoms in isolation. Now; you had been diagnosed with acid reflex and looking to understand why you have it; these lectures will help you. In the first section will define few terms and set up goals for the course. In the second section you will learn the basics of anatomy and physiology of the esophagus and stomach; you will understand how they work and why the work that way. The third section will cover the clinical presentation of GERD. After completing that section you will be able to match your symptoms with “classic” or “unusual” presentations. In the fourth section you will learn about the “standard” treatment of GERD with OTC and prescription medications. You will also learn about possible side effects of these medications. In the fifth section you will learn about individual approaches to treatment. By this point you should already have identified the cause of your individual condition. Look for your solution in this section. I hope to see you in my course. Here’s to your health.,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Introduction To Hibernate; PluralSight; online Technology courses,N/A,Online Course - Introduction To Hibernate,PluralSight,Free Trial,03:58:08,Yes,John Sonmez,In the world of Java; one of the most popular and widely used frameworks is Hibernate. Hibernate is an ORM; or Object Relational Mapper; that allows developers to map Java objects to relational database tables. It is a valuable tool that all Java developers should know how to use. The problem is; learning Hibernate can be difficult. Hibernate is a very large framework and there are many important concepts to understand to use it effectively. This course is designed to make getting started with Hibernate as easy as possible and focus on the most important things you need to know. We start off this course by learning a bit about Hibernate and how it works; and then see how to get it setup with a real MySQL database installation. After that; we learn the very basics of mapping; which is one of the most important things to understand about Hibernate. I ll show you how to create a basic mapping for a Java object to a relational table and explain to you how the mapping works. But most real world applications have more complex mapping that often trips up new developers and experienced developers alike. So; we ll also cover some of the complex mapping situations like mapping collections and different relational mappings like one-to-many and many-to-one. Once you ve learned how to map you objects; you ll want to know how to query them; so I ll show you how to do this using Hibernate s built in HQL and using a more object oriented approach with the Criteria API. Finally; we ll wrap things up by taking a brief tour of some of the more advanced features like caching and interceptors. So; if you are wanting to learn how to use Hibernate; or if you ve been struggling through using Hibernate in an existing application; but never really understood what was going on; this course will give you the knowledge you need to feel confident about how Hibernate works and how to use it.,Intermediate,?

The classical literature explained in this course does not simply give students an insight into a classic text; it will open up a new perspective with which to view other works in the future.,Appropriate for all,?

Pourquoi ses idées ont-elles exercé une telle influence au 16e siècle et dans les siècles suivants ? Ce cours cherchera à répondre à ces deux questions. Il mettra en évidence l’humanisme de Calvin; sa compréhension de la pensée biblique; son acuité théologique; son sens aigu des problèmes sociaux et politiques. Nous aurons aussi l’occasion d’évoquer l’apport de Calvin à la culture (notamment à la langue française; qui lui doit considérablement) et à la conception de l’humain devant Dieu et dans la société. Nous verrons également comment Calvin fit de Genève la capitale d’une idée et d’un idéal de vie chrétienne; en pensant le rapport au travail et à l’argent ou en créant des institutions comme la Compagnie des pasteurs; le Consistoire et l’Académie. Ce cours mettra également en évidence la place que Calvin occupe dans l’histoire de la tolérance; ou plutôt de l’intolérance; religieuse : l’affaire Servet (du nom de ce savant espagnol condamné à mort à Genève pour hérésie) fera ainsi l’objet d’une analyse spécifique. Nous tenterons également de montrer les apports de la théologie de Calvin (notamment la compréhension renouvelée d’un Dieu en qui l’humain peut faire confiance) et ses limites (par exemple la doctrine dite de la prédestination). Ce cours d’introduction fera également une place à l’histoire du calvinisme en Europe (France; Allemagne; Provinces-Unies; Angleterre) et dans le monde (Amérique; Afrique du Sud; Asie). Le cours est donné en français avec sous-titres en anglais. --- Who was John Calvin? Why were his ideas so influential in the 16th century and well beyond his time? This course seeks to answer these two questions. We will present his humanistic leanings; his interpretation of the Bible; his theological vision; his acute sense of social and political questions. We will consider his contribution to culture; how he contributed to shaping French language; his understanding of the human before God and in society. The course will address how Calvin sought to transform the city of Geneva into an idea and an ideal of Christian life; by thinking the meaning of work and money; but also by creating educational and ecclesiastical institutions (the « Company of Pastors »; the « Consistory » and the « Academy »). The course will locate Calvin within the history of religious toleration; or rather of religious intolerance. We will analyse the fate of Michel Servet; a learned Spanish man who was condemned for heresy and executed in Geneva in 1553. With regard to Calvin’s theology; we will show both his lasting contribution (especially his understanding of a God in whom one may trust) as well as the limitations of his thought (for instance his doctrine of predestination). Towards the end of this introductory course; we will turn our attention to the history of Calvinism in Europe (France; Germany; the United Provinces; England) and in various parts of the world (Americas; South Africa and Asia).

Price: Free. Duration: 7 weeks.  Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Unethical Decision Making in Organizations; Coursera; online Humanities courses,N/A,Online Course - Unethical Decision Making in Organizations,Coursera,Free,7 weeks,Yes,N/A,Whenever we hear about ethical scandals; we tend to believe that unethical or illegal behavior in organizations is driven by character deficiencies of individual actors. Put differently; we simply assume that bad things are done by bad people (so-called bad apples). However; numerous corporate scandals; such as Enron; Ford; or Siemens; have demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the rules if they are put into a corrupt context. Good apples may become rotten in bad barrels. Regardless of their good intentions and strong values; individual actors might adapt to the unethical practices in their respective organizational context and; over time; lose the ability to see their wrongdoings. They become ethically blind. Such changes in people’s way of seeing the world and their value systems can occur in—and through—various organizational contexts in business; civil society; and public administration. This course is not about apples but about barrels and barrel makers. A better understanding of why and under what conditions good people make bad ethical decisions will enable us to better protect individuals as well as their respective organizations against the overwhelming power of the context. It will also enable us to cure societies from problems like corruption. The goal of this course is to empower students to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It will draw from various disciplines such as management; psychology; sociology; philosophy; and literature; in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding of unethical behavior. The course will also analyze some of the most eminent organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these disciplines.,Appropriate for all,?

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Master the ACT; Udemy; online Education courses,N/A,Online Course - Master the ACT,Udemy,$29,10 hours,Yes,Patrick Garvey, Master the ACT  is a comprehensive; start-to-finish ACT prep program designed to help students achieve their maximum potential score on test day. That means we ll cover all four sections of the test in great detail; providing the explanations and strategy you need to make your ACT score stand out on your college applications. As a veteran ACT instructor; I have spent hundreds of hours perfecting strategies and explaining concepts to students in a live classroom environment. While it s nice to get to work with students in-person; it is very difficult to teach at a pace that is optimal for everyone. I ve learned that every student starts at their own place with standardized tests like the ACT and has his or her own unique mix of strengths and weaknesses. On top of that; live courses are very expensive and many students never get the opportunity to enroll. When I discovered Udemy; I realized that I finally had the opportunity to build the ideal ACT prep course - one that is affordable and allows everyone to truly learn at their own pace. The course format and curriculum is designed around the following principles: Uses only authentic ACT questions for practice and explanation Every drill and practice problem set has a clear purpose Comprehension of test material comes first; then timing and strategy Multiple learning tools (video; audio; text; etc.) reinforce comprehension Reviewing mistakes and learning from them is key to significant improvement The best study plan is one that is custom tailored to match your skills; goals; and schedule Why is The Real ACT Prep Guide (3rd Edition) a course requirement? The reason is simple - it is the only book on the market that contains authentic ACT questions from official tests given to students in previous years. On top of that; it contains five full-length practice tests with an explanation for every single question! Other books and companies attempt to mimic the test by creating their own ACT-style questions; but this approach is simply less effective for students. Although this added requirement reduces the number of students able to take the course; I cannot stand behind any test prep product that does not use the authentic questions. Please message me if you are having trouble purchasing the book - I am working on creative ways to make sure anyone who wants to take this course has that opportunity! Disclaimer: The creators of this course have no affiliation with the makers of The Real ACT Prep Guide. Below are a few pieces of feedback I have received from my ACT students:  Before we started working together I told Patrick my goal was to score above 30 on the ACT. He designed every step along the way around that goal and by the time the test came around I felt totally ready. I ended up surpassing that score on the actual test and; honestly; it came as no surprise based on the work we did.  - Aaron; freshman @ Centre College  My ACT score went up 3 points in 5 weeks of working with Patrick! We used a diverse set of resources and he helped make the test preparation actually fun for a change.   - Ellie; freshman @ Vanderbilt University  Not only did Patrick cover all of the basic ACT material in detail; but he broke down each question I struggled with until it made complete sense. We went over the structure of the test and he gave me a strategy to attack each section. There is no doubt that his instruction was a major factor in my success. Highly recommended!  - Christina; freshman @ College of Charleston  The customized plan we created helped me go from being very intimidated by the ACT to feeling totally confident in my abilities and preparation. Before Patrick s class; I was dreading the college application process. Now; I m going into my senior year with a great ACT score and I m actually excited about applying to schools. It s a great feeling.  - Sean; freshman @ University of Kentucky If you live in the Louisville; KY area and are interested in private tutoring; send me a message or email me at patrickgarvey88@gmail.com.,Appropriate for all,?

In this course you will learn how to determine “Why?” a student engages in challenging behavior and develop interventions that promote positive behaviors; replacing challenging behavior. Whether teaching in a general education or special education setting; the key to effective behavior intervention is the functional behavior assessment.   There are various forms of the functional behavior assessment.  We will focus on how teachers can use the direct method of functional behavior assessment as part of their classroom routine.  In this course you will learn how to conduct an FBA.  You will learn how to analyze the FBA to determine the antecedents that set the stage for challenging behavior; and determine the function of the behavior. You will also be able to use what you learn about principles of reinforcement;  to create a function based intervention addressing the antecedents; consequences and promoting replacement behaviors.   What you learn in this course will help you intervene with challenging behaviors in your classroom before they escalate into behaviors that require involvement of additional school faculty and staff beyond your classroom. ,Appropriate for all,?

It was always part of a global economy; tied into networks of capital; labor; and commodity markets that spanned continents. The wealth of the slave South was absolutely central to the political and economic growth of the U.S. and its emergence as a continental empire in the nineteenth century; but ultimately that system had to be destroyed for the country to claim its place as a world power. Why that was – why the U.S. experienced a brutal Civil War in the 1860s – is a matter of considerable contention among scholars and a central theme of the course. The history of the South is a crucial part of the story of the rise of the U.S. as a global power and it is particularly compelling because of its history as a slaveholding society; the wealthiest in the western world in 1860. This course is about the ethical and political questions that history necessarily poses about the relationship between slavery; capitalism; and democracy in U.S. and world history.  It is about the rise and fall of the slave South from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the end of the American Civil War.,Appropriate for all,?
