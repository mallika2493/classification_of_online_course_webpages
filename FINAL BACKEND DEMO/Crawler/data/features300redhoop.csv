This course will teach you from the smallest parts of pronunciation to the biggest parts and help you train your accent each step of the way.  This course will take you over 3 hours to complete but remember that an accent takes time and training to change; so it is suggested that you do only one section per week and train every day. The recommended time is approximately 13 weeks to complete the course. This course is for anyone who wants to understand how English pronunciation works and change their accent.,Appropriate for all,?

https://redhoop.com/udemy-learn-guitar-in-21-days-1303-2.html,Online Course - Learn Guitar in 21 Days,It s an online Music course offered by Udemy. Price: Free. Duration: 2.5 hours.  Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Learn Guitar in 21 Days; Udemy; online Music courses,N/A,Online Course - Learn Guitar in 21 Days,Udemy,Free,2.5 hours,Yes,TrueFire .com,Most beginners think that you need to know thousands of chords to play thousands of songs. NOT SO! You really only need to know a handful of chords and a few strumming patterns to play thousands of rock; folks; blues and pop songs. The reason guitar is the most popular instrument on the planet is because it s the quickest and easiest instrument to learn how to play. You do NOT need to read music. You do NOT need to learn music theory. You do NOT need to struggle through exercises; or practice scales; or learn how to play Mary Had A Little Lamb. Fact is that thousands of popular songs can be played with 8 simple chords or less. Learn just the A chord; D chord and E chord and you ll be able to play hundreds of blues; folk; pop and rock songs. Why is this so? Because rock; pop; folk and blues songwriters all use the same handful of chords - it s their melodies and arrangements that make their songs distinctive; NOT the chords they are using in the song. So; if you learn that handful of chords; and learn those few strumming patterns; along with the basics of holding and tuning a guitar; then you too will be able to play thousands of songs. And that s the simple truth. World renowned guitar educator Ravi has taught thousands of people to play their favorite songs on guitar with his breakthrough 21-day course. The  trick  behind this course is really no trick at all; over the 21 days you ll learn how to hold and tune the guitar; how to play eight simple chords; how to strum; and how to keep a beat. No gimmicks. No  magic  formula. No nonsense. You will need to set 20 minutes a day aside for your practice sessions. No more and no less. And you are asked to do this for 21 days straight. Yes; you can skip a day or two but the daily repetition and practice regiment is the key to your success. Ravi has also included additional lessons for you to work with beyond the 21 days. You ll learn more open position chords; the moveable barre chord system (worth the price of admission alone!); how to read chord charts; and how to easily and quickly learn songs from sheet music; song books and lyric sheets that you download from the internet. Ravi will step you through the course and each of your practice sessions on the video lessons. Follow the course for those 21 days and beyond and we guarantee that you ll be prepared to start playing and building your own repertoire of favorite songs to accompany yourself or play in a band setting. No; you will not be an Eric Clapton in 21 days and we wouldn t suggest you book your first gig on the 22nd day BUT you will be a guitar player and you will be well equipped to learn ALL of your favorite songs. If you ve always wanted to learn to play guitar so that you can strum along and sing your favorite songs; Learn Guitar in 21 Days is likely the answer you ve been seeking. Grab your guitar; boot up Ravi s first lesson and let s start making music right away! NOTE! We get asked all the time why a guitar educational company with so many advanced courses would offer such a simple solution to learning guitar without having to learn how to read music; learn theory or work through a more  formal  learning methodology. The answer is really simple; you never stop learning music but you do have to start. If your introduction to music is boring; tedious and generally a struggle; you ll likely pack the guitar up in its case and stick it in the closet. If it s fun; engaging and you can prove to yourself that you can really do it; then you ll spend a lifetime enjoying and learning guitar. Hopefully; TrueFire and our massive library of instruction will enhance that lifetime of enjoyment.,Appropriate for all,?

We re about to do some trekking—photo trekking—with travel and lifestyle photographer Nick Onken. Nick was originally educated as a graphic designer but ultimately found that making images with a camera was more fulfilling—and you can see that he didn t leave his design skills behind when he picked up the camera. We follow Nick around New York City as he meets with Cosmopolitan s photo editor; photographs a fashion model; and returns to his home in Brooklyn to share his story with us. We also meet the founder of Pencils of Promise; a nonprofit organization that builds schools in underdeveloped countries; and uses Nick s photographs as the centerpiece of its fundraising efforts. Then we re off to Guatemala to watch him create his magic. Nick shows us how he has evolved as an artist and how the business of photography has changed—for example; using an online portfolio as opposed to the traditional  book  that art directors review. He s energetic; motivated; and talented. We ve captured him for the lynda.com Creative Spark series but it was no easy task getting him to sit still.,Appropriate for all,?

Syllabus: Week 1: Strategy Strategy is the long-term direction and scope of an organization as that organization pursues advantage through its configuration of resources; to meet the needs of markets and to fulfill stakeholder expectations (Johnson and Scholes 2006). Corporate strategy addresses which business a corporation will participate in; and business strategy focuses on how a particular business competes within its industry. Week 2: Entrepreneurship Shane and Venkataraman (2000; p. 218) define the academic field of entrepreneurship as the “scholarly examination of how; by whom; and with what effects opportunities to create future goods and services are discovered; evaluated; and exploited.” Why do some people; and not others; discover and exploit the opportunities that are the heart of entrepreneurship? Week 3: Leadership Leadership is a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal. We look at competing views of what leaders should do; what they actually do; how leaders establish organizational culture; and what are the elements of constructive leadership. Week 4: Organization and Processes Organizational design is the alignment of structure; process; rewards; metrics; and talent with the strategy of the business. In this chapter; we describe what has (and has not) been established to promote organizational effectiveness. Week 5: International Business All companies—even new companies in new industries—must consider the global environment in which they operate. Key international business literature addresses dimensions such as theories of multinational enterprises; international political economy; multinational management; and culture. These dimensions provide managers with tools and concepts needed for growing beyond national borders. Week 6: Innovation Contexts for innovation vary based on location; industry; and country. We look here at how innovation diffuses or spreads and thus how current technology such as the web and social media might affect the adoption of innovative outputs. It is essential that managers understand the contexts for innovation at the firm; industry; and country levels in creating and managing innovation strategies. Week 7: Finance Finance is the study of how investors allocate their assets over time under conditions of certainty and uncertainty; and typically examines the relationship between money; time; and risk.

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Probabilistic Graphical Models; Coursera; online Math and Science courses,N/A,Online Course - Probabilistic Graphical Models,Coursera,Free,10 weeks,Yes,Daphne Koller; Professor,What are Probabilistic Graphical Models? Uncertainty is unavoidable in real-world applications: we can almost never predict with certainty what will happen in the future; and even in the present and the past; many important aspects of the world are not observed with certainty. Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world; and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions; and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century; our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent; and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework; which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields; uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces; often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains; which include: web search; medical and fault diagnosis; image understanding; reconstruction of biological networks; speech recognition; natural language processing; decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel; robot navigation; and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations. In this class; you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them; using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence; and for making good decisions under uncertainty. The class covers both the theoretical underpinnings of the PGM framework and practical skills needed to apply these techniques to new problems.,Appropriate for all,?

This is often feasible and cost-effective when manual programming is not. Machine learning (also known as data mining; pattern recognition and predictive analytics) is used widely in business; industry; science and government; and  there is a great shortage of experts in it. If you pick up a machine learning textbook you may find it forbiddingly mathematical; but in this class you will learn that the key ideas and algorithms are in fact quite intuitive. And powerful! Most of the class will be devoted to supervised learning (in other words; learning in which a teacher provides the learner with the correct answers at training time). This is the most mature and widely used type of machine learning. We will cover the main supervised learning techniques; including decision trees; rules; instances; Bayesian techniques; neural networks; model ensembles; and support vector machines. We will also touch on learning theory with an emphasis on its practical uses. Finally; we will cover the two main classes of unsupervised learning methods: clustering and dimensionality reduction. Throughout the class there will be an emphasis not just on individual algorithms but on ideas that cut across them and tips for making them work. In the class projects you will build your own implementations of machine learning algorithms and apply them to problems like spam filtering; clickstream mining; recommender systems; and computational biology. This will get you as close to becoming a machine learning expert as you can in ten weeks!,Appropriate for all,?

Este curso gratuito de cinco semanas está orientado a todos los que hablan español que desean mejorar sus competencias en la toma de decisiones estratégicas en el panorama empresarial; y establecer simultáneamente redes con hispano parlantes alrededor de todo el mundo. Los estudiantes desarrollarán un proyecto trabajando en equipo a distancia y habrá retroalimentación entre los diferentes grupos. Enseña como construir un flujo de caja y como calcular su valor actualizado neto (VAN) y otros indicadores de su rentabilidad. Cubre temas conceptuales como los costos y beneficios pertinentes. También aspectos prácticos como el tratamiento de la depreciación; la estimación del capital de trabajo; y la determinación del horizonte de evaluación y del valor residual. Y cubre asuntos más técnicos como el cálculo de la tasa con la que se deben descontar los flujos o costo del capital. Se explica como incorporar en la evaluación los aspectos estratégicos del proyecto. Enseña como valorizar su ventaja competitiva; y como incorporar las fuerzas que atentan contra la sustentación de las rentabilidades en el tiempo: la imitación; la sustitución y otras. Y explica como valorizar la flexibilidad inherente al proyecto; de ampliarse si se reciben buenas noticias; y de reducirse en caso contrario. El curso muestra también como hacer uso de la información disponible en la industria; en los estados financieros y en los precios de mercado. Respecto a estos precios se explica; por ejemplo; el método de valorización por múltiplos. Este permite definir un rango para el valor del proyecto; directamente a partir de información del mercado financiero; de precios de acciones de empresas comparables; cuando estas empresas existen. El curso resalta las mejores prácticas en la construcción de los flujos de cajas; en la incorporación de la estrategia y en la recolección de la información. Por ejemplo; a la hora de definir un proyecto se recomienda no combinar decisiones separables y no separar proyectos complementarios o competitivos.

The new standards specifically describe the importance of students understanding the reasoning of others and engaging in meaningful conversations using evidence for claims. Yet this type of student-to-student interaction tends to be rare in classrooms. Common classroom teaching activities such as whole class discussions; jigsaws; and think-pair-shares can have the appearance of constructive interactions; but they often do not provide adequate opportunities for all students to engage in back-and-forth dialog. This short course looks closely at student-to-student conversations and addresses ways to improve students  abilities to engage in the types of interactions described in the new standards. This course consists of four sessions with three weeks between each session in order to provide extra time for application and reflection. The learning in this course relies heavily on participant contributions and comments. The sessions and assignments are designed for participants who teach or have access to classrooms in which they can gather samples of students’ conversation during lessons. Finally; we include resources and tasks for instructional coaches and others who support teachers and build school-wide capacity. Please note that this is a slightly modified version of a previous course offered in Fall; 2013. This course is targeted towards secondary school teachers. We hope you will join us on this exciting journey. Check out course highlights » More Information Prerequisites In order to participate in the course; you will need to have access to a classroom in which you or the teacher you are observing are able to collect short samples of paired student talk two different times. Frequently Asked Questions Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment? This course may be taken for a free statement of accomplishment. How much of the time commitment will this course be? Online work will take around 1 hour per week; assignments will take around 1 hour per week. Any additional textbooks or software required? No. Syllabus Weeks 1-2: Constructive Conversations I In these two weeks we dive into what high-quality talk between students can sound like in lessons that effectively teach the new standards. Specifically; we focus on the features of “constructive interactions;” during which students create; clarify; support; and negotiate ideas as they talk about concepts and build understandings in a discipline. Weeks 3-4: Teaching the Constructive Conversation Skills These two weeks focus on instruction to support rich interaction introduced in Module 1. We analyze video clips that show teaching that fosters interaction skills described in the new standards. We look at activities that help students build interactions skills for staying focused on objectives; building and negotiating ideas; and clarifying ideas. Weeks 5-6: Constructive Conversations II These two weeks we will look more in depth at how to foster student interactions that build the learning of lesson objectives; challenge thinking; and push students to use more complex language of the Common Core standards. Week 7: Collaboration; Communication; and Community This will be a summative week; when we will pull together everything we’ve covered in the course to create a product that communicates to other teachers the value of having a discourse focus for implementing the new standards. You will also consider next steps for applying and collaborating in this work during the year.,Appropriate for all,?

Duration: 6 weeks.  Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Introduction to Music Production; Coursera; online Music courses,N/A,Online Course - Introduction to Music Production,Coursera,Free,6 weeks,Yes,Loudon Stearns,With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware; the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But; if you dig deeper; you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge; dedication; and creativity.      Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making; there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools; loosely following along the music production process of recording; editing; and mixing. We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer; so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process.      Once recorded; sound must be organized along a timeline; a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW);  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. After editing; sounds must be combined or mixed together; so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards; including volume; pan; mute; solo; busses; inserts; sends; and submixes. The mixing process; however; includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed; modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression; equalization; and delay; and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.      We will then explore the synthesizer; a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes; great music can and will be created without the synthesizer; but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form; so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication.     In the end; the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there; unexpressed; until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head; it will take numerous steps; each with an important tool; to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity; and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.,Appropriate for all,?

As computers become more powerful; Neural Networks are gradually taking over from simpler Machine Learning methods. They are already at the heart of a new generation of speech recognition devices and they are beginning to outperform earlier systems for recognizing objects in images. The course will explain the new learning procedures that are responsible for these advances; including effective new proceduresr for learning multiple layers of non-linear features; and give you the skills and understanding required to apply these procedures in many other domains.

If you haven’t written any or many songs; this course will show you an efficient; effective process for tailoring songs to express your ideas and emotions. If you have; you’ll look at your process differently; taking control of aspects of the process you may have not noticed. The course will start by examining the tools available to you; all revolving around the essential concept of prosody. You’ll learn to use your tools to enhance your message—to work compositionally at the same time you’re developing your ideas. You’ll be working both lyrically and musically; though musically it’s not necessary that you either read music or play an instrument. If you play; great; and you’ll be encouraged to play and record your musical responses to the assignments. If you don’t play; the course offers you a number of musical loops to work with. All you’ll have to do is sing your melodies over the loops. Assignments will ask you to post something for peer review—sometimes lyric lines or sections; sometimes melodies; sometimes both. None of it has to be polished. The course is about writing; not performing. Most important; you’ll have a lot of fun.,Appropriate for all,?

The new standards specifically describe the importance of students understanding the reasoning of others and engaging in meaningful conversations using evidence for claims. Yet this type of student-to-student interaction tends to be rare in classrooms. Common classroom teaching activities such as whole class discussions; jigsaws; and think-pair-shares can have the appearance of constructive interactions; but they often do not provide adequate opportunities for all students to engage in back-and-forth dialog. This short course looks closely at student-to-student conversations and addresses ways to improve students  abilities to engage in the types of interactions described in the new standards. This course consists of four sessions with three weeks between each session in order to provide extra time for application and reflection. The learning in this course relies heavily on participant contributions and comments. The sessions and assignments are designed for participants who teach or have access to classrooms in which they can gather samples of students’ conversation during lessons. Finally; we include resources and tasks for instructional coaches and others who support teachers and build school-wide capacity. Please note that this is a slightly modified version of a previous course offered in Fall; 2013. This course is targeted towards elementary school teachers. We hope you will join us on this exciting journey. Check out course highlights » More Information Prerequisites In order to participate in the course; you will need to have access to a classroom in which you or the teacher you are observing are able to collect short samples of paired student talk two different times. Frequently Asked Questions Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment? This course may be taken for a free statement of accomplishment. How much of the time commitment will this course be? Online work will take around 1 hour per week; assignments will take around 1 hour per week. Any additional textbooks or software required? No. Syllabus Weeks 1-2: Constructive Conversations I In these two weeks we dive into what high-quality talk between students can sound like in lessons that effectively teach the new standards. Specifically; we focus on the features of “constructive interactions;” during which students create; clarify; support; and negotiate ideas as they talk about concepts and build understandings in a discipline. Weeks 3-4: Teaching the Constructive Conversation Skills These two weeks focus on instruction to support rich interaction introduced in Module 1. We analyze video clips that show teaching that fosters interaction skills described in the new standards. We look at activities that help students build interactions skills for staying focused on objectives; building and negotiating ideas; and clarifying ideas. Weeks 5-6: Constructive Conversations II These two weeks we will look more in depth at how to foster student interactions that build the learning of lesson objectives; challenge thinking; and push students to use more complex language of the Common Core standards. Week 7: Collaboration; Communication; and Community This will be a summative week; when we will pull together everything we’ve covered in the course to create a product that communicates to other teachers the value of having a discourse focus for implementing the new standards. You will also consider next steps for applying and collaborating in this work during the year.,Appropriate for all,?

Making the transition from being a grad student in TESOL; or even from being an ESL/EFL teacher to teaching EAP can be daunting. This course seeks to fill that training gap; and will; hopefully; provide you with the knowledge you need to get started teaching EAP. Please note that this course does not cover teaching composition or academic writing; as those areas would require their own course. The aim here is to give you a foundation from which you can build a course. Writing is mentioned briefly here; but you would do well to do some independent research on teaching second language writing. In addition; you are not given strategies for teaching academic reading in this course. The students in your EAP class will be doing plenty of extensive reading; and the way this EAP course is designed; they will improve their reading due to the sheer volume of assigned tasks. I would strongly recommend visiting http://eolf.univ-fcomte.fr/index.php?page=academic-reading-and-writing-exercises to learn more about academic reading and writing.

I’ve looked at several courses over the years but never felt compelled to try one until now. My entire family took it and is busy creating our wheels so we can get started. Thank you again! - Philip Top Class - I m in the middle of the course but just to shout out that its so so amazing... The concept and motivation is excellent. Thanks for making and publishing this course.highly recommended - Code Breaker Brilliant!!! - Thank you for this course; it s very useful to help you reach your goals; and I think it s just brilliant!!! - Antonia  Okay; this is free?  - So at least half a million people should get through the meat of it! The idea is based on Benjamin Franklin s 13 Virtues with a few twists to make the ideas more practical. Love it; in other words!  - Laura.  Delivers more than you expect.  - Short enough to work through in one sitting but enough material to revisit and learn something new. Simple; new ideas that can be implemented right now. Plenty of “a – ha!” moments for me. - Cathy. So; what s it all about? Well; do you ever ask yourself;  I KNOW I could be doing more with my life; but HOW?  Let s face it. You have a busy life with a zillion distractions... and this can lead to a loss of focus; and not getting what you want out of life. You join the gym in January but by the end of February... The guitar you bought is in the spare room gathering dust... You ve got a copy of  The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People  on your bookshelf; you know it s a great book yet you haven t opened it since 1995... You decided to learn French; and after 3 weeks you think maybe Spanish would have been better; and 3 years later you re still just speaking loud English when you go abroad... Sound familiar? You re not alone. Most of the population is in the same boat as you. It s pretty normal. Only a tiny percentage of the people on the planet have the self-discipline of an Olympic athlete. And I for one; am certainly not in that group. I don t have an iron will. I don t even have a tin will. Probably more like cardboard if I m honest. So; the standard approach to achieving your goals just doesn t really appeal to me; since the standard approach involves ME having to change. The standard approach is basically just  have more self-discipline ; just  get better . That s why I created a different approach. One that works for me; for (almost) all of us. And I didn t even have to do that much as the great Benjamin Franklin had already done most of the work. I just added a few tweaks; made it even more accessible and added a few thought algorithms to make it even easier to implement. This approach is to use a system that gets the job done with minimum willpower; this approach involves not having to change. So; you have two options: 1. Change 2. Be yourself + Use a System Choose easy. Choose Option 2. Make the smart choice. Take the red pill. So; instead of increasing our willpower; let s use a system that works with a minimum amount of will. We re still going to have to do the work; it s just that we won t have to use up any of our energy forcing ourselves to do the work. I m not afraid of work. In fact; none of us are really afraid of work. We re afraid that we won t stick at things because that s what we ve done in the past. We re afraid that if we try we might fail; and so after a while; we d rather not try. We re afraid we re not good enough. We re afraid we don t have enough willpower. We re not afraid of doing the work; we re afraid that our work won t work! So; what s going to be easier for you? Carrying on the same way; making resolutions; getting disappointed; giving up on yourself; starting to wonder if you re ever going to get what you want out of life? Or using a system that gets it done with minimum willpower.

The only prerequisite is a basic knowledge of how to read musical notation. Otherwise; no prior experience is needed; all concepts will be explained in class; and musical terms will be defined as they arise. This course will focus on Western classical music of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; music that exemplifies tonality; the system of major and minor keys; including pieces composed by Bach; Mozart; Beethoven; Schubert; Schumann; Chopin; Wagner; Brahms; Richard Strauss; and others. This course will tell two competing stories about tonal music and try to reconcile them. On one hand; we will explore what all tonal pieces have in common; the shared musical language that makes them intelligible and allows them to communicate; on the other hand; we will try to discover what makes each piece unique; how composers bend the common language to say something new. Although the course will incorporate historical perspectives; it will not be a chronological survey. Instead; it will combine music theory with aesthetics; balancing principles of structural organization with insights into the aesthetic meaning and effects of these principles. By illustrating his lectures with his own performances at the keyboard; Professor Korsyn will bring the music to life.,Appropriate for all,?

This model presents six stages; or “brain targets” of the teaching and learning process. The components include (1) establishing the emotional climate for learning; (2) creating the physical learning environment; (3) designing the learning experience; (4) teaching for the mastery of content; skills; and concepts; (5) teaching for the extension and application of knowledge; and (6) evaluating learning. A central theme of the model is the integration of the arts to foster retention of new information; conceptual development; and higher-order thinking and creative problem-solving. Course objectives: Describe themes in brain research that can inform educational practice consistent with the Brain-Targeted Teaching® Model. Describe how emotional and physical learning environments affect learning. Identify themes in brain research that educators can apply as they design instruction; teach for mastery of content; skills; and processes; design activities to apply and extend knowledge; and evaluate learning.,Appropriate for all,?

Macleod; Jen Ross and Christine Sinclair,E-learning and Digital Cultures is aimed at teachers; learning technologists; and people with a general interest in education who want to deepen their understanding of what it means to teach and learn in the digital age. The course is about how digital cultures intersect with learning cultures online; and how our ideas about online education are shaped through “narratives”; or big stories; about the relationship between people and technology. We’ll explore some of the most engaging perspectives on digital culture in its popular and academic forms; and we’ll consider how our practices as teachers and learners are informed by the difference of the digital. We’ll look at how learning and literacy is represented in popular digital-; (or cyber-) culture; and explore how that connects with the visions and initiatives we are seeing unfold in our approaches to digital education. This course will not be taught via a series of video lectures. Rather; a selection of rich resources will be provided through which you can begin to engage with the themes of the course. While the teachers will be present in the discussion forums and in various other media environments; there will be an emphasis on learner-led group formation; and the use of social media to build personal learning networks and communities of peers. On this course; you will be invited to think critically and creatively about e-learning both as a process and as a topic of study; you will be able to try out new ideas in a supportive environment; and gain fresh perspectives on your own experiences of teaching and learning.  This course is also intended to be an exploration  of the MOOC format itself.  Rather than approaching this course with the expectation of exacting teaching methods or precise learning routines; we invite all participants to collectively experiment with what the MOOC experience might be. The course assessment will involve you creating your own digital artefact: something that is designed to be experienced digitally; on the web. It will be likely to contain a mixture of text; image; sound; video; links; and can be created in the environment of your choice. The artefact will be a representation of any of the themes encountered during the course; and you‘ll have the opportunity to use digital spaces in new ways to present this work. Our definition of ‘digital artefact’ is intentionally imprecise to invite experimentation and creativity: it will be evaluated via guided peer-assessment. This course has been developed collaboratively by a team of experienced teachers and researchers in online education; who run the international MSc in Digital Education distance programme at the University of Edinburgh.,Appropriate for all,?

After producing Ditch Auto: Start Shooting In Manual; feedback suggested that I do a workflow course. This is the first of many workflow courses to come. Despite our best efforts; not all of our photos will turn out golden right from the camera. It is often that we have to run a photo through Lightroom and even Photoshop to give it that look we were looking for when we took the photo in the first place. The photo we will be editing in this course is a photo of my good friend s Subaru Impreza STI. The car is nice; but the lighting situation for this photo was not. The sun was almost gone and I had to stretch my camera just to get the shot. The result; was not a photo I was very proud of but I knew had potential if I just spent some time on it. In this course I take a photo and edit it completely in Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Photoshop. You will learn my complete workflow for bringing an image back to life. In this course I cover: Importing of images into Adobe Lightroom Image Adjustment Settings in Lightroom Repair of Underexposed and Noisy Images How to bring back detail in the image Opening a photo in Photoshop from Lightroom Editing and Cleanup in Photoshop Sky Replacement Returning to Lightroom to Color Correct Watermarking Image Export You will need Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop to follow along with this course. Thankfully; you can now get both of these applications through Adobe Creative Cloud for as little as $9.99 per month. The benefit of Adobe s Creative Cloud is that you never have to pay full price for Adobe software and you get all of the updates and upgrades for free. I like their new subscription model because it allows me to have the latest software without having to drop at least $1;000 each year. My goal is to help you become a solid Lightroom and Photoshop user and editor so you can get the most detail and definition out of your photos. This course is for you or someone you know who struggles with Lightroom and/or Photoshop. If you have ever taken a photo that just didn t pop but you knew had potential; this course is for you.,Appropriate for all,?

Page,We live in a complex world with diverse people; firms; and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel; unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings; market crashes; and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don t. And; moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one. Why do models make us better thinkers? Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class; I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds; models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor; and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes; whether they be in economics; political science; business; or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life. Here s how the course will work. For each model; I present a short; easily digestible overview lecture. Then; I ll dig deeper. I ll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won t require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures; I ll offer some questions and we ll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive; and take all the quizzes and the exam; you ll receive a certificate of completion. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that s fine too. It s all free. And it s all here to help make you a better thinker!

That question is at the core of The Ancient Greek Hero; which introduces (or reintroduces) students to the great texts of classical Greek culture by focusing on concepts of the Hero in an engaging; highly comparative way. The classical Greeks  concepts of Heroes and the  heroic  were very different from the way we understand the term today. In this course; students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts; in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general. In Greek tradition; a hero was a human; male or female; of the remote past; who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue; as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures; ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans; but on a much larger scale. Further; despite their mortality; heroes; like the gods; were objects of cult worship – a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course. The original sources studied in this course include the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey; tragedies of Aeschylus; Sophocles; and Euripides; songs of Sappho and Pindar; dialogues of Plato; historical texts of Herodotus; and more; including the intriguing but rarely studied dialogue  On Heroes  by Philostratus. All works are presented in English translation; with attention to the subtleties of the original Greek. These original sources are frequently supplemented both by ancient art and by modern comparanda; including opera and cinema (from Jacques Offenbach s opera Tales of Hoffman to Ridley Scott s science fiction classic Blade Runner). The true hero of the course is the logos ( word ) of reasoned expression; as activated by Socratic dialogue. The logos of dialogue requires both careful thought and close (or  slow ) reading; which is a core skill taught in this class. The course begins by considering the heroes of Homer s epics and ends with Plato s memories of the final days of Socrates -- memories which can only be fully understood by a reader who has gained a thorough comprehension of the ancient Greek hero in all his or her various manifestations. Using modern technology and engaging texts; The Ancient Greek Hero provides students who have no previous background in classical Greek civilization with a fully engaging and immediately accessible introduction to the most beautiful moments in this ancient literature; its myths; and its ritual practices.

We respond to markets all the time: prices influence our decisions; markets signal where to put effort; they direct firms to produce certain goods over others. Economics is all around us.  This course is a rigorous introduction to the microeconomic theory of markets: why we have them; how they work; what they accomplish. We will explore what outcomes they generate when they work well and what happens when they do not. We will learn why governments are important and when regulation and intervention is necessary. Examples are taken from everyday life; from goods and services that we all purchase and use. We will apply the theory to current events and policy debates through weekly exercises. These will empower you to be an educated; critical thinker who can understand; analyze and evaluate market outcomes.,Appropriate for all,?

That’s why; in our view; character development and content mastery act as the two complementary halves of remarkable teaching. But they’re often perceived to be in competition. When you ask parents about their goals for their children; they almost always respond with terms like; “successful;” “happy;” “curious;” and “being kind to others.” But when you ask schools about their goals; they often reply in terms of academic content; like “algebra;” “subject-verb agreement;” and “the periodic table.” Great teachers have always united those two visions. This course explores the interconnection between character research; education; and academic rigor. During our sessions; we’ll cover the field of positive psychology as it relates to character strengths; as well as the concepts of Growth Mindset; Constructive Responding; and Character Behavior Language. We will engage with the existing research; hear from eminent scholars in the field and top K-12 educators; and view footage of classroom teachers integrating these ideas into their classroom instruction. The course will explore questions like: How can positive psychology help us maximize student engagement and accomplishment? What does it look like to implement a growth mindset in your classroom? Can you teach grit in the classroom? If so; how? Should an educator measure character? If so; how?,Appropriate for all,?

Stark,Statistics 2 at Berkeley is an introductory class taken by about 1000 students each year. Stat2.2x is the second of three five-week courses that make up Stat2x; the online equivalent of Berkeley s Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.2x is on probability theory: exactly what is a random sample; and how does randomness work? If you buy 10 lottery tickets instead of 1; does your chance of winning go up by a factor of 10? What is the law of averages? How can polls make accurate predictions based on data from small fractions of the population? What should you expect to happen  just by chance ? These are some of the questions we will address in the course. We will start with exact calculations of chances when the experiments are small enough that exact calculations are feasible and interesting. Then we will step back from all the details and try to identify features of large random samples that will help us approximate probabilities that are hard to compute exactly. We will study sums and averages of large random samples; discuss the factors that affect their accuracy; and use the normal approximation for their probability distributions. Be warned: by the end of Stat2.2x you will not want to gamble. Ever. (Unless you re really good at counting cards; in which case you could try blackjack; but perhaps after taking all these edX courses you ll find other ways of earning money.) As Stat2.2x is part of a series; the basic prerequisites are the same as those for Stat2.1x: high school arithmetic and good comprehension of English. In addition; you are expected to know the material of Stat2.1x; with particular emphasis on histograms; averages; SDs; and the normal curve. The fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout the course; the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations; the assumptions under which they are valid; and the correct interpretation of results.,Appropriate for all,?

COURSE OVERVIEW Iran’s nuclear ambitions; the slaughter in Syria’s civil war; WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information — these are among the challenges American national security students in 211x will wrestle with this year.  This introduction is based on one of the most popular; and dynamic; courses taught at Harvard s Kennedy School of Government. In each case; students are cast as a trusted NSC staffer to President Obama; or to another principal in the policy-making process.  Each case requires not only reexamining current U.S. strategy; but also identifying alternative strategies for protecting and advancing national interests. In each of these cases; which include a special two-week segment on the disclosures surrounding NSA surveillance and the trove of WikiLeaks documents of previously-secret American policymaking; participants have to operate in the rough-and-tumble of a government whose deliberations are discombobulated by leaks; reports about internal differences among policymakers; and press analyses. Weekly assignments require strategic thinking: analyzing dynamics of challenges and developing strategies for addressing them.  Students learn to summarize their analyses in a succinct “Strategic Options Memo” that combines careful analysis and strategic imagination; on the one hand; with the necessity to communicate to major constituencies in order to sustain public support; on the other. They also examine how policymaking is affected by constant; public analysis of government deliberations.,Appropriate for all,?

This course will help international students (non-U.S. citizens) and non-native English speakers navigate the U.S. university admission process by offering practical information about the documents and pieces that make up a U.S. university application.  More importantly; admission officers will discuss how they use those pieces to decide who is accepted and who is denied; so that you can understand the process beyond the pieces. By the end of this course; you will understand application basics that include researching schools; creating a school list; and establishing an application plan.  This course will not answer all of your application questions; but it will teach you to ask the right questions of yourself and the universities.  Ultimately; you will have all the information you need to start your process the right way; putting you on the path to acceptance. * Please note; while the English Language Programs are part of the University of Pennsylvania; this is not a course about applying to Penn.  Furthermore; this course is intended for international students educated in the national curriculum of their country.  While other students are welcome to enroll; the course is not intended for American students or students studying in an American; International Baccalaureate; or Advanced Placement curriculum.  The course is also intended for students who do not have access to university counseling – if you attend a school that offers university counseling; your counselor is the best source of information on applying to university.  Finally; this course is for undergraduate (Bachelors degree) freshmen (students who have not attended any university) applicants.  Undergraduate transfer applicants; students who have attended a university; will find some of the information helpful; but graduate (Masters and Doctoral) applicants will not.,Appropriate for all,?

At this time; you can only explore this course in a self-paced fashion. Certain features of this course may not be active; but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course. 8.02 is the second semester of the MIT introductory physics sequence. Passing the online version of this course will guarantee you an MITx certificate of achievement The course is on electricity and magnetism which are at the heart of Maxwell s equations. We will study electric fields; magnetic fields; electromagnetic forces; conductors and dielectrics; electromagnetic waves; and the nature of light. This online version follows the MIT on-campus class as it was given by the renowned Professor Walter Lewin in the spring of 2002; and includes his video lectures and problem solving sessions. Professor Lewin; proclaimed  a Web Star  by The New York Times; has supplemented his lectures specifically for 8.02x by including interactive questions to help students check their understanding during the lectures themselves. Also; the course uses prize-winning animations and interactive simulations developed under the leadership of Professor John Belcher for MIT s Technology Enabled Active Learning (TEAL) classroom. In addition to the basic concepts of Electromagnetism; a vast variety of interesting topics are covered in this course including: Lightning; Electric Shock Treatment; Electrocardiograms; Metal Detectors; Musical Instruments; Magnetic Levitation; Bullet Trains; Electric Motors; Radios; TV; Car Coils; Superconductivity; Aurora Borealis; Rainbows; Radio Telescopes; Interferometers; Particle Accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider; Mass Spectrometers; Red Sunsets; Blue Skies; Haloes around Sun and Moon; Color Perception; Doppler Effect; Big-Bang Cosmology. You will complete automatically graded weekly homework problems and a series of exams using multiple choice; numerical and symbolic questions to test your understanding and to help you master the material. Lectures are interspersed with questions that must be answered before advancing to the next lecture segment. There is a moderated forum for student-to-student threaded discussions. While homework deadlines will be strictly enforced; the lowest homework grade will be dropped. Your grade will be based on interactive questions during the lectures (5%); homework problems and simulations (20%); three midterm exams (15% each); and the final exam (30%). Depending on what percentage of all the points you get; your grade will be as follows: A (more than 85%); B (70-85%); C (60-70%). At least 60% of the points must be obtained to qualify for a certificate of mastery. ABOUT THE LECTURES Lewin s lectures at MIT are legendary. Many have been shown for over six years (starting in 1995) on UWTV in Seattle; reaching an audience of about four million people. For fifteen years (starting in 1983) he was on MIT Cable TV helping freshmen with their weekly homework assignments. His programs; which were aired 24 hours per day; were also frequently watched by upper-class students. Additionally; his 35 lectures on Newtonian Mechanics; 36 lectures on Electricity and Magnetism and 23 lectures on Vibrations and Waves can also be viewed at MIT S OpenCourseWare; iTunes U; YouTube and Academic Earth. These lectures are being watched by about 5000 people daily from all over the world; that s about two million people per year! Many teachers show them regularly in their class rooms; and Bill Gates wrote Professor Lewin that he has watched all his lectures more than once; and that he learned a lot from them. The many responses that Professor Lewin receives daily are quite wonderful and often very moving.,Appropriate for all,?

Jakicic and Amy D. Rickman,Over 65 percent of adults and over 30 percent of children meet the classification of being overweight or obese; and with this excess weight comes numerous health conditions that include heart disease; diabetes; cancer; musculoskeletal disorders; and even impairments in cognitive function. Because in most cases the core cause of obesity and its related health conditions is a poor quality of diet and lack of sufficient physical activity; it is no surprise that to reverse this health problem a foundation of proper nutrition and sufficient physical activity is imperative. This course is designed to provide a foundation of nutritional knowledge to develop a sustainable pattern of healthy eating. To this will be added a foundation of knowledge related to physical activity and exercise. These two key lifestyle behaviors are then brought together under the umbrella of calorie balance; which is the understanding of how we balance the calories that we eat in our diet with the calories that we burn to sustain life and to perform all of our daily tasks and functions. Ultimately; this information can only be of value if individuals understand how to engage in these healthy behaviors within their daily lives when they are faced with challenges and barriers. This course will address key issues and will provide information on effective strategies for adopting and maintaining these targeted behaviors as they apply to the adoption and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle.,Appropriate for all,?

Appreciating how animal s experience the world they live in and the different behavioural needs of the various species we interact with; enables us to gain a better understanding of their welfare requirements; so that long term improvements to animal lives can be made.   There are now more than 60 billion land animals raised for meat each year around the world; and with increasing human populations and a rise in meat consumption in many parts of the world; these figures are set to double by 2050. Added to this is a huge and growing world population of dogs and cats; many of whom are strays with associated health and welfare issues.  International concern for animal welfare continues to grow with rising demand for measures to protect animals and improve their care and wellbeing. The link between animal welfare and human wellbeing is clear; and yet we still have a long way to go if we are to address welfare needs globally. Finding ways to achieve higher standards of animal welfare; is therefore a key priority for any developed and developing nation. Due to gaining in importance internationally; there is increasing recognition of the need for animal welfare issues to be addressed objectively in a scientifically credible manner. In this animal behaviour and welfare course; you will learn about animal welfare and why it matters; develop an understanding of some of the main welfare issues animals have to cope with as well as gaining an insight into the behavioural needs and the emotions of dogs; cats; farmed animals and captive wildlife. This course is delivered collaboratively by academics from the University of Edinburgh and Scotland s Rural College (SRUC).  ,Appropriate for all,?

C. Compeau,The sequencing of the human genome a decade ago fueled a computational revolution in biology; which has arguably been an impetus for more new algorithms than any other fundamental realm of science.  The newly formed links between computer science and biology affect the way we teach computational ideas to biologists; as well as how applied algorithms are taught to computer scientists.  Genome sequencing is just one of hundreds of biological problems that have become inextricable from the computational methods required to solve them. In this course; we will take a look at some of the algorithmic ideas that are fundamental to an understanding of modern biology.  Computational concepts like dynamic programming and graph theory will help us explore algorithms applied to a wide range of biological topics; from finding regulatory motifs to reconstructing the tree of life.  Throughout the process; we will apply real bioinformatics algorithms to real genetic data. We have created an interactive textbook for this course; which allows you to learn and solve problems concurrently.  This textbook will be hosted on Stepic; a new resource for learning interactively.,Appropriate for all,?

Should reading; watching; memorizing facts; and then taking exams be the only way to learn? Or could technology (used effectively) make learning more interactive; collaborative; and constructive? Could learning be more engaging and fun? We construct; access; visualize; and share information and knowledge in very different ways than we did decades ago. The amount and types of information created; shared; and critiqued every day is growing exponentially; and many skills required in today’s working environment are not taught in formal school systems. In this more complex and highly-connected world; we need new training and competency development—we need to design a new learning environment. The ultimate goal of this project-based course is to promote systematic design thinking that will cause a paradigm shift in the learning environments of today and tomorrow. Participants are not required to have computer programming skills; but must have 1) a commitment to working in a virtual team and 2) the motivation to help people learn better. All of us have been involved in the learning process at some point in our lives; in this course we invite educators; school leaders; researchers; students; parents; entrepreneurs; computer programmers; illustrators; interface designers; and all those who are interested in working together; to create a new learning environment. After the completion of this course; students will be able to: - Identify advantages; disadvantages; limitations; and potentials of at least 10 interactive learning models and solutions. - Describe how online communication; collaboration; and visualization technology play a role in the behavioral; cognitive; constructivist; and social dimensions of learning. - Describe the major components and processes involved in development of interactive education systems. - Communicate rationales of learning technology design approaches through team-oriented collaborations. - Evaluate the value of ideas; principles; and techniques used in educational media or systems. As a Final Team Project; students will design a new learning model catering to 21st century environments and learners. Each self-formed team will design and develop an application or system that combines team interaction activities and learning support features in ways that are effective and appropriate for today s computing and communication devices. Students must consider potential idiosyncrasies with various learning devices (e.g.; tablet; phone; PC); infrastructure requirements (e.g.; cellular network; wi-fi; Bluetooth); and any special hypothetical circumstances if relevant. In addition; each team must create and defend a business model (non-profit; for-profit; or hybrid) for the launch and scale up their solution. Additional consideration will be given to teams that come up with system feature ideas presenting meaningful learning interaction and performance analytics.

These are three topics that build on the same mathematical background and that have several important connections: for example it is possible to find graph clusters via random walks; and it is possible to use the linear programming approach to graph partitioning as a way to study random walks. We will study spectral graph theory; which explains how certain combinatorial properties of graphs are related to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix; and we will use it describe and analyze spectral algorithms for graph partitioning and clustering. Spectral graph theory will recur as an important tool in the rest of the course. We we will also discuss other approaches to graph partitioning via linear programming and semidefinite programming. Then we will study constructions of expander graphs; which are graphs with very strong pseudorandomness properties; which are useful in many applications; including in cryptography; in complexity theory; in algorithms and data structures; and in coding theory. Finally; we will study the mixing time of random walks; a problem that comes up in several applications; including the analysis of the convergence time of certain randomized algorithms; such as the Metropolis algorithm.

Click to learn more and find similar courses.,Understanding Europe: Why It Matters and What It Can Offer You; Coursera; online Humanities courses,N/A,Online Course - Understanding Europe: Why It Matters and What It Can Offer You,Coursera,Free,8 weeks,Yes,N/A,Regardless of where you live; the European Union has a large; yet often unnoticed; impact on many aspects of your everyday life. Whether you are traveling; eating; working; doing business; shopping; surfing the Internet or breathing; all these activities are largely shaped by the EU.  As a result no global citizen; business leader; lawmaker; lobbyist or student can effectively operate in Europe or in the world without a solid understanding of this unique laboratory of integration. While the EU is often depicted as a monstrous bureaucratic creature; condemned to irrelevance by the emerging economies; it remains the most accomplished experiment of economic; social and political integration in human history. In 50 years the EU accomplished what other countries took centuries to realize. Given its inherent complexities; Understanding Europe aims at popularizing the intricacies of the European Union system to promote greater awareness of the opportunities it offers you. Ultimately; you will not only better grasp the applicable framework for any European economic or social activity you engage in; but you will also participate on the EU stage. By confronting you with several current EU policy proposals; you will be able to ‘have a say’ in the EU policymaking process. We want to empower you as a citizen and business operator to maximize your rights and opportunities in today’s Europe. Understanding Europe is structured upon some basic yet critical questions about the EU’s purpose and legitimacy : why does the EU exist? How does it work? What can it offer you? The course then analyzes the European public sphere by focusing on its main actors (the European Parliament; the Commission; the Council; the Court of Justice of the EU) and the role European citizens play in influencing Europe. We then move to the Union’s powers (what can the EU do? How far can it go? Do Members States have some instruments to “block” EU action? Can EU citizens challenge EU action?) by discussing the limits to its action and describing some of its policies. The course then analyzes the role and opportunities citizens and all stakeholders may have in shaping EU policies through public consultation; the European Citizens Initiative and other forms of participatory democracy. In a further step; we will analyze what the EU is doing for you regardless of where you are based in the world. Finally; by taking stock of what you have learned in the previous weeks; we will look at what you can do for and in Europe. Throughout the whole course; participants will be confronted with real-life examples of EU action. EU affairs professionals will share their personal EU experiences and tell us about their EU jobs. You can interact with the instructor and other participants; share your opinions; question the instructor’s assumptions and hence shape the course’s content. ,Appropriate for all,?
