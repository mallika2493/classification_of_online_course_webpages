https://redhoop.com/udemy-the-inexplicable-universe-unsolved-mysteries-11655-2.html	Online Course - The Inexplicable Universe: Unsolved Mysteries	N/A	Online Course - The Inexplicable Universe: Unsolved Mysteries	Udemy	$99	3 hours	Yes	The Great Courses	"Everything we now know about the universe—from the behavior of quarks to the birth of entire galaxies—has stemmed from scientists who’ve been willing to ponder the unanswerable. And with the advent of modern science, great minds have turned to testing and experimentation rather than mere thought as a way of approaching and grappling with some of the universe’s most pressing and vexing dilemmas. So what is our latest picture of some of the most inexplicable features of the universe? What still remains to be uncovered? What are some of the next avenues of exploration for today’s chemists, physicists, biologists, and astronomers? Pondering the answers to these and other questions is a great way to ·appreciate the grandeur and complexity of the world around you, ·better understand and discuss news and developments in science, and ·spark further interest in some of science’s many exciting areas of study. “We know a lot about the universe. But there’s even more that we don’t know,” says astrophysicist and Professor Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium, an award-winning lecturer, and one of the world’s foremost experts on the secrets of the universe. And his course The Inexplicable Universe: Unsolved Mysteries is the perfect gateway into this mind-bending and eye-opening subject. This visually stunning course, which has been honored with a 2013 Telly Award for Outstanding Educational Program, features six self-contained lectures that transport you on a marvelous journey to the frontiers of the known (and unknown) universe and introduce you to tantalizing questions being addressed by the world’s top scientists. Undeniably engaging and fascinating, this lecture series is a wonderful entrée to scientific pursuits that lie at the very heart of the history and nature of our universe. An Informed Scientific Conversation Central to The Inexplicable Universe is the way it takes you deep into hidden layers of the universe in a manner that is extremely accessible. Rather than a stern lecture given before a podium complete with confusing mathematics, Professor Tyson’s lectures have the feel of an informed conversation that manages to be both thorough and easy to grasp. With each of the inexplicable mysteries he lays bare for you, Professor Tyson ·introduces you to the history behind it, ·lays out the science that has helped us grasp it, ·explains what researchers have discovered to date, and ·reveals what we have yet to discover. And while the topics explore subjects in everything from quantum mechanics to cosmology to string theory, you’ll never feel overwhelmed by what you’re learning. In fact, you’re more likely to find yourself intrigued by just how much we know—and curious about what the near future will possibly reveal. Explore Fascinating Territory So what territory will you chart in this course? Here are some of the inexplicable ideas you’ll investigate in these lectures. ·Neutrinos: Discovered in 1956, these fast-moving, ghostlike particles are made in abundance in the sun’s core. They hardly interact with matter; it takes a light-year’s worth of lead (5.8 trillion miles) to stop a neutrino. Not only that, but 65 billion neutrinos pass through every centimeter of your body that’s facing the sun every second of every day. ·String theory: This astounding theory offers the hope of unifying all the particles and forces of physics. In the past several decades since the dawn of string theory, it’s been imagined that all the fundamental particles we see and measure are just the manifestation in our dimension of strings vibrating in higher dimensions and at different frequencies. ·Quantum foam: This idea posits that when the fabric of space and time is so tightly curved on itself, space-time is less a smooth curve and more like the froth on a latte. In this state of matter and energy, quantum fluctuations can spawn entire universes, each with slightly different laws of physics within them! In addition, you’ll also ·get a peek at what it would be like to travel through a black hole, ·ponder the possibility that life on Earth originated in debris from Mars, ·probe the supposed existence of multiple universes, and ·even imagine the possible end of the universe itself. A One-on-One Chat with a Renowned Science Educator Professor Tyson is renowned throughout the scientific community and the media for his vast knowledge, his penetrating insights, and his amazing ability to make even the most intimidating areas of science accessible, engaging, and—most of all—enjoyable. He brings the same inviting tone and sharp intellect to The Inexplicable Universe as he does to his range of media appearances on popular television programs, including The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and Real Time with Bill Maher. Professor Tyson’s lectures also feature expertly crafted animations, explanatory graphics, and other instructive visual elements designed to better explain to you some of the grand, intricate ideas being discussed. With The Inexplicable Universe, you’ll feel as if you’re participating in an exclusive chance to sit one-on-one with this renowned science educator and have a provocative, intriguing, and illuminating conversation. No other learning experience—including the most detailed science textbook—can bring you this close to interacting with an expert about the mysteries of the universe around you.

The course is aimed at students with little or no prior programming experience who have a desire (or at least a need) to understand computational approaches to problem solving. Some of the people taking the course will use it as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many, it will be their first and last computer science course. Since the course will be the only formal computer science course many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, it is not a ""computation appreciation"" course. It is a challenging and rigorous course in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will. Those who earn a passing grade will get an honor code certificate from MITx. Please see the edX FAQ for more information about certificates. The required textbook for this course is Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python (Spring 2013 edition) by John Guttag. The MIT Press has generously provided free access for MITx students to an online version of the required textbook for the duration of the course. The open, online version offers the full text of the book in a static, read-only format (not searchable or downloadable for use offline). The book will also be published in both print and e- book editions in January 2013 by the MIT Press. Both editions of the book are priced at $25.00 and are now available from retailers. Limited-time offer! The MIT Press is offering MITx students a special price, through March 22, 2013 only, of $17.50 (a 30% discount). To take advantage of this offer, please use promotion code ICPUP30 at http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python. Note to students who purchased the Fall 2012 edition of this textbook: If you already own a copy of the Fall 2012 version of Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python by John Guttag, please be aware that the newly released Spring 2013 edition of the book reflects numerous corrections and minor revisions throughout. You may use the Fall 2012 edition for this Spring course but you are strongly advised to regularly compare its text against the open online edition of the Spring 2013 edition (which will be freely posted within the Spring 6.00x courseware). Alternatively, you may wish to purchase the Spring 2013 edition if you are able. In the meantime, if you're interested in reading more on Python, check your local library for Python textbooks or search online for a free Python text, such as this one.

Take a look at the “Class Summary,” “What Should I Know,” and “What Will I Learn” sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring. Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you’re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped. What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out. What should I do while I’m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material."	Intermediate	1

Can we program machines to learn like humans? This Reinforcement Learning course will teach you the algorithms for designing self-learning agents like us! Reinforcement Learning is the area of Machine Learning concerned with the actions that software agents ought to take in a particular environment in order to maximize rewards. You can apply Reinforcement Learning to robot control, chess, backgammon, checkers, and other activities that a software agent can learn. Reinforcement Learning uses behaviorist psychology in order to achieve reward maximization. This course includes important Reinforcement Learning approaches like Markov Decision Processes and Game Theory. Please refer to the Syllabus for a detailed breakdown of topics. You can expect to spend 8-10 hours per week on this course. Series Information: Machine Learning is a graduate-level series of 3 courses, covering the area of Artificial Intelligence concerned with computer programs that modify and improve their performance through experiences. Machine Learning 1: Supervised Learning Machine Learning 2: Unsupervised Learning Machine Learning 3: Reinforcement Learning (this course) If you are new to Machine Learning, we recommend you take these 3 courses in order. The entire series is taught as a lively and rigorous dialogue between two eminent Machine Learning professors and friends: Professor Charles Isbell (Georgia Tech) and Professor Michael Littman (Brown University). What Will I Learn? You will learn about Reinforcement Learning, the field of Machine Learning concerned with the actions that software agents ought to take in a particular environment in order to maximize rewards. Michael: Reinforcement Learning is a very popular field. Charles: Perhaps because you're in it, Michael. Michael: I don't think that's it. In this course, you will gain an understanding of topics and methods in Reinforcement Learning, including Markov Decision Processes and Game Theory. You will gain experience implementing Reinforcement Learning techniques in a final project. What Should I Know? We recommend you take Machine Learning 1: Supervised Learning and Machine Learning 2: Unsupervised Learning prior to taking this course. An introductory course like Udacity's Introduction to Artificial Learning provides a helpful background for this course. Some experience in programming (for example, taking Udacity's Introduction to CS), and basic familiarity with statistics and probability theory is recommended. Udacity's Intro to Statistics, especially Lessons 8, 9 and 10, may be helpful. The most important prerequisite for enjoying and doing well in this class is your interest in the material.
