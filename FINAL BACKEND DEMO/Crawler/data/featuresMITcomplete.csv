We will look at how genres are divided into subgenres; and how they are combined into cross-genre work; always keeping in mind the Reader-Writer Contact that is at the heart of genre writing.  We shall also think about the ways in which crossing genres has led to the establishment of new genres (steampunk; preternatural romance) and strongly established subgenres (historical mystery; urban fantasy).,writing;creative writing;fiction;fiction writing;writing fiction;genre fiction;genre;genres;fantasy;fantasy writing;science fiction;mystery;historical fiction;preternatural romance;horror;steampunk;workshop;revision;American Literature;Creative Writing;Fiction,education;learning;free;,Genre Fiction Workshop ,MIT Open CourseWare,N/A,any time,No,Lewitt; Shariann ,Some argue that genre fiction is only a marketing category; but other critics say that different genres meet specific expectations of readers.

These seminars are tailored for students with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about current biological research in a highly interactive setting. To understand and treat any disease with a genetic basis or predisposition; scientists and clinicians need effective ways of manipulating the levels of genes and gene products. Conventional methods for the genetic modification of many experimental organisms are technically demanding and time consuming. Just over 5 years ago; a new mechanism of gene-silencing; termed RNA interference (RNAi); was discovered. In addition to being a fascinating biological process; RNAi provides a revolutionary technology that has already changed the way biomedical research is done and that may even prove useful for genetic interventions in a clinical context. In this course; students learn how RNAi was discovered; how it works; and what its physiological relevance might be. How RNAi can be harnessed to modulate gene expression and perform genetic screens; both in cells and in various organisms is also covered. Finally; this course examines the first attempts to use RNAi for the treatment of models of human diseases in experimental animals.,RNA interference;RNAi;RNA;genetic analysis;gene therapy;gene products;gene silencing;gene expression;human disease models;mRNA;genetic interference;short interfering RNA;siRNAs;expression vectors;RNA sequences;nucleotide fragments;microRNA;mRNA degradation;transgenic mice;lentivirus;knock-down animals;tissue specificity;Genetics;Functional Genomics,education;learning;free;,RNA Interference: A New Tool for Genetic Analysis and Therapeutics ,MIT Open CourseWare,N/A,any time,No,Kissler; Stephane and Ventura; Andrea ,This course is one of many Advanced Undergraduate Seminars offered by the Biology Department at MIT.

Most differentiated cells therefore retain all of the genetic information necessary to generate an entire organism. It was through pioneering technology of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) that this concept was experimentally proven. Only 10 years ago the sheep Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult organism; demonstrating that the differentiated state of a mammalian cell can be fully reversible to a pluripotent embryonic state. A key conclusion from these experiments was that the difference between pluripotent cells such as embryonic stem (ES) cells and unipotent differentiated cells is solely a consequence of reversible changes. These changes; which have proved to involve reversible alterations to both DNA and to proteins that bind DNA; are known as epigenetic; to distinguish them from genetic alterations to DNA sequence. In this course we will explore such epigenetic changes and study different approaches that can return a differentiated cell to an embryonic state in a process referred to as epigenetic reprogramming; which will ultimately allow generation of patient-specific stem cells and application to regenerative therapy.

http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2010/,Performance Engineering of Software Systems | Electrical Engineering and Computer Science | MIT OpenCourseWare,Modern computing platforms provide unprecedented amounts of raw computational power. But significant complexity comes along with this power; to the point that making useful computations exploit even a fraction of the potential of the computing platform is a substantial challenge. Indeed; obtaining good performance requires a comprehensive understanding of all layers of the underlying platform; deep insight into the computation at hand; and the ingenuity and creativity required to obtain an effective mapping of the computation onto the machine. The reward for mastering these sophisticated and challenging topics is the ability to make computations that can process large amount of data orders of magnitude more quickly and efficiently and to obtain results that are unavailable with standard practice. This class is a hands-on; project-based introduction to building scalable and high-performance software systems. Topics include performance analysis; algorithmic techniques for high performance; instruction-level optimizations; cache and memory hierarchy optimization; parallel programming; and building scalable distributed systems. The course also includes design reviews with industry mentors; as described in this MIT News article.,performance analysis;algorithmic techniques;high performance;instruction level optimization;cache optimization;memory optimization;parallel programming;scalable distributed systems;Software Design and Engineering;Algorithms and Data Structures;Theory of Computation;Data Mining;Systems Optimization,education;learning;free;,Performance Engineering of Software Systems ,MIT Open CourseWare,N/A,any time,No,Amarasinghe; Saman and Leiserson; Charles ,Modern computing platforms provide unprecedented amounts of raw computational power.

http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/literature/21l-701-literary-interpretation-virginia-woolfs-shakespeare-spring-2001/,Literary Interpretation: Virginia Woolf s Shakespeare | Literature | MIT OpenCourseWare,How does one writer use another writer s work?&nbsp;Does it matter if one author has been dead 300 years? What difference does it make if she s a groundbreaking twentieth-century feminist and the writer she values has come to epitomize the English literary tradition? How can a novelist borrow from plays and poems? By reading Virginia Woolf s major novels and essays in juxtaposition with some of the Shakespeare plays that (depending on one s interpretation) haunt; enrich; and/or shape her writing; we will try to answer these questions and raise others. Readings in literary criticism; women s studies; and other literary texts will complement our focus on the relationship--across time; media; and gender--between Shakespeare and Woolf.&nbsp;As a seminar; we will work to become more astute readers of literature within its historical; artistic; and political contexts; and consider how literature both reflects and contributes to these societal frameworks.&nbsp;Central texts will include Shakespeare s Othello; Antony and Cleopatra; Cymbeline; and The Winter s Tale; and Woolf s A Room of One s Own; Mrs. Dalloway; Orlando; To the Lighthouse; The Waves; and Between the Acts.

These seminars are tailored for students with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about current biological research in a highly interactive setting. This seminar provides a deeper understanding of the post-translational mechanisms evolved by eukaryotic cells to target proteins for degradation. Students learn how proteins are recognized and degraded by specific machinery (the proteasome) through their previous tagging with another small protein; ubiquitin. Additional topics include principles of ubiquitin-proteasome function; its control of the most important cellular pathways; and the implication of this system in different human diseases. Finally; speculation on the novel techniques that arose from an increased knowledge of the ubiquitin-proteosome system and current applications in the design of new pharmacological agents to battle disease is also covered.,ubiquitination;ubiquitin;proteasome;post-translational mechanisms;ubiquitin-conjugation system;neurodegenerative diseases;immune response;cell cycle regulation;apoptosis;signal transduction pathways;tumorigenesis;protein degradation;Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degradation Pathway;ligases;translocated proteins;misfolded proteins;trafficking membranes;cell cycle control;programmed cell death;Huntington s Disease;Von Hippel-Lindau Disease;Cell Biology;Cellular and Molecular Medicine,education;learning;free;,Ubiquitination: The Proteasome and Human Disease ,MIT Open CourseWare,N/A,any time,No,Rubio; Marta ,This course is one of many&nbsp;Advanced Undergraduate Seminars offered by the Biology Department at MIT.

The first part of the course examines literature on the history and theory of the city. Among other factors; it pays special attention to the larger territorial settings in which cities emerged and developed (ranging from the global to the national to the regional&nbsp;context) and how these affected the nature; character; and functioning of cities and the lives of their inhabitants. The remaining weeks focus more explicitly on the theory and practice of design visions for the city; the latter in both utopian and realized form. One of our aims will be to assess the conditions under which a variety of design visions were conceived; and to assess them in terms of the varying patterns of territorial &quot;nestedness&quot; (local; regional; national; imperial; and global) examined in the first part of the course. Another will be to encourage students to think about the future prospects of cities (in terms of territorial context or other political functions and social aims) and to offer design visions that might reflect these new dynamics.,understandings of the city;social science literature and the field of urban design;literature on the history and theory of the city;larger territorial settings;nature; character; and functioning of cities;lives of inhabitants;theory and practice of design visions for the city;utopian;utopian and realized form;patterns of territorial ?nestedness?;future prospects of cities;territory;cities;context;local;national;global;urban settings;city design;social justice;politics of change;urban design;history;theory;territorial settings;urbanites;city dwellers;inhabitants;nestedness;regional;imperial;politics;sociology;Sociology;Urban Studies;Environmental Design;Comparative History,education;learning;free;,City Visions: Past and Future ,MIT Open CourseWare,N/A,any time,No,Davis; Diane and Vale; Lawrence ,This class is intended to introduce students to understandings of the city generated from both social science literature and the field of urban design.

http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-753-geodynamics-seminar-spring-2001/,Geodynamics Seminar | Earth; Atmospheric; and Planetary Sciences | MIT OpenCourseWare,The Earth s crust is primarily composed of melting products from mantle plumes and mid-ocean ridges - both presently and over the course of Earth history. While both systems represent upwelling features in a convective mantle; they can be viewed as end-member systems in that plumes represent buoyant flow whereas mid-ocean ridges represent passive corner flow. This paradigm is not strict - flow beneath ridges may be buoyant in some places; for example; but it does provide a reasonable framework for enquiry. Plumes and ridges can be studied independently; but in many places across the globe the systems interact; often in intriguing fashion. The nature of these interactions provides an opportunity to improve our understanding of both systems; and provides new perspectives on the mantle; crustal; and water column processes associated converting heat from the Earth s interior into new crust; hydrothermal flow; and biological communities on the seafloor. The approach taken for the 2001 Plume-Ridge Interactions Seminar series was to start with basic ideas about mantle convection and tectonics; and an overview of the global hotspot and ridge systems. We then addressed three case studies of plume-ridge interactions in detail. Our first case was the interaction of the.

As a by-product of this harvest; they isolated a green fluorescent protein (GFP). Since then; GFP has triggered a revolution in our understanding of gene expression and signaling in live cells. In this seminar; we will examine how this small protein generates fluorescence; i.e. absorbs light of one wavelength and emits light of a longer wavelength. We will discuss how the color palette has been extended from green to blue; red and many other colors; based on protein engineering of GFP and the study of vividly colorful coral reefs. We will then investigate how these fluorescent proteins can be used to track the motion of DNA; RNA and protein in living cells; as well as to see waves of signaling molecules propagate across a cell.

Lectures will cover the theoretical background on some of the major areas in high-level vision; as well as an overview of what fMRI has taught us and can in future teach us about each of these topics. Lectures and discussions will also cover fMRI methods and experimental design. A prior course in statistics and at least one course in perception or cognition are required.,Undergraduate,?

It is an approach that enables professionals to understand how they use their knowledge in practical situations and how they can combine practice and learning in a more effective way. Through greater awareness of how they deploy their knowledge in practical situations; professionals can increase their capacities of learning in a more timely way. Understanding how they frame situations and ideas helps professionals to achieve greater flexibility and increase their capacity of conceptual innovation. The objective of the course is to introduce students to the approach and methods of reflective practice by raising their awareness about their own cognitive resources and how they use them in their practice. The course will introduce theories of learning; knowledge generation; framing and reframing; theories of action; reflection-in-practice; and conceptual innovation; and provide students with opportunities to experiment with these theories in real life through practical exercises in which they reflect on real situations that they have faced in their past professional experience.

http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-665b-power-and-negotiation-fall-2002/,Power and Negotiation | Sloan School of Management | MIT OpenCourseWare,This course is designed to provide you with a competitive advantage in negotiation. You will learn and practice the technical skills and analytic frameworks that are necessary to negotiate successfully with peers from other top business schools; and you will learn methods for developing the powerful social capital you will need to rise in the executive ranks of any organization. In this course; you will learn to successfully face the challenge of negotiating materially rewarding deals while also building your social capital. You will work with training materials on leadership and relationship building that have been used with over 200 principals and partners in international professional service firms (40% were non-US nationals); and a social capital assessment tool used by these executives to receive feedback from senior partners and over 2000 clients. In addition; you will have the opportunity to participate in a lunchtime workshop on  Leadership and Emotional Intelligence  led by an executive coach; Charles Wolfe of Charles J Wolfe Associates. Overall; this course is designed to enhance your ability to negotiate within the context of an ongoing relationship. As a manager; consultant; or professional service provider you will negotiate with your counterparts; team members; clients; and subordinates on an ongoing basis. Further; in today s less hierarchical organizations; you will be forced to negotiate with others to get your work done. Every time a project falls behind; critical new information is uncovered; or the competitive landscape of your industry changes; you will need to renegotiate tasks; plans; goals; or fees with your key stakeholders. In sum; we will focus both on the analytic tools necessary to become a highly successful negotiator and on the relationship building skills necessary to negotiate deals that will enhance your social capital; your ability to lead others; and your book of loyal clients.,negotiation;distributive bargaining;integrative;communication;coalition;multiparty;Leadership;Management;Professional Development;Communication,education;learning;free;,Power and Negotiation ,MIT Open CourseWare,N/A,any time,No,Williams; Michele ,This course is designed to provide you with a competitive advantage in negotiation.

In the early stages of the present course; we will make somewhat greater use of math than did 12.003; but the math we will use is no more than that encountered in elementary electromagnetic field theory; for example. The focus of the course is on the physics of the phenomena which we will discuss.,Undergraduate,?

How are our senses of vision; smell; taste and pain controlled at the cellular and molecular levels? What causes medical conditions like allergies; hypertension; depression; obesity and various central nervous system disorders? G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) provide a major part of the answer to all of these questions. GPCRs constitute the largest family of cell-surface receptors and in humans are encoded by more than 1;000 genes. GPCRs convert extracellular messages into intracellular responses and are involved in essentially all physiological processes. GPCR dysfunction results in numerous human disorders; and over 50% of all prescription drugs on the market today directly or indirectly target GPCRs. In this course; we will discuss GPCR signal transduction pathways; GPCR oligomerization and the diseases caused by GPCR dysfunction. We will study the structure and function of rhodopsin; a dim-light photoreceptor and a well-studied GPCR that converts light into electric impulses sent to the brain and leads to vision. We will also discuss how mutations in rhodopsin cause retinal degeneration and congenital night blindness.

The emphasis throughout the course is on the development and application of conceptual models which clarify the interactions between competition; patterns of technological and market change; and the structure and development of organizational capabilities. This is not a course in how to manage product or process development. The main focus is on the acquisition of a set of powerful analytical tools which are critical for the development of a technology strategy as an integral part of business strategy. These tools can provide the framework for deciding which technologies to invest in; how to structure those investments and how to anticipate and respond to the behavior of competitors; suppliers; and customers. The course should be of particular interest to those interested in managing a business for which technology is likely to play a major role; and to those interested in consulting or venture capital.,disruptive technology;strategy;models;analysis;competition;change;organizational competence;vertical integration;S-curves;organizational strategy;market evolution;market dynamics;simple rules;worse before better;standards;tipping;complementary assets;capturing value;value chain;network effects;market share;innovation;Marketing;Management;Leadership;Information Technology,education;learning;free;,Technology Strategy ,MIT Open CourseWare,N/A,any time,No,Davis; Jason ,This course provides a series of strategic frameworks for managing high-technology businesses.

http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-100c-real-analysis-fall-2012/,Real Analysis | Mathematics | MIT OpenCourseWare,This course covers the fundamentals of mathematical analysis: convergence of sequences and series; continuity; differentiability; Riemann integral; sequences and series of functions; uniformity; and the interchange of limit operations. It shows the utility of abstract concepts and teaches an understanding and construction of proofs. MIT students may choose to take one of three versions of Real Analysis; this version offers three additional units of credit for instruction and practice in written and oral presentation.The three options for 18.100:Option A (18.100A) chooses less abstract definitions and proofs; and gives applications where possible.Option B (18.100B) is more demanding and for students with more mathematical maturity; it places more emphasis from the beginning on point-set topology and n-space; whereas Option A is concerned primarily with analysis on the real line; saving for the last weeks work in 2-space (the plane) and its point-set topology.Option C (18.100C) is a 15-unit variant of Option B; with further instruction and practice in written and oral communication. This fulfills the MIT CI requirement.     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE

integral;Fourier series;Calculus;Mathematical Analysis,education;learning;free;,Real Analysis ,MIT Open CourseWare,N/A,any time,No,Seidel; Paul ,This course covers the fundamentals of mathematical analysis: convergence of sequences and series; continuity; differentiability; Riemann integral; sequences and series of functions; uniformity; and the interchange of limit operations. It shows the utility of abstract concepts and teaches an understanding and construction of proofs. MIT students may choose to take one of three versions of Real Analysis; this version offers three additional units of credit for instruction and practice in written and oral presentation.The three options for 18.100:Option A (18.100A) chooses less abstract definitions and proofs; and gives applications where possible.Option B (18.100B) is more demanding and for students with more mathematical maturity; it places more emphasis from the beginning on point-set topology and n-space; whereas Option A is concerned primarily with analysis on the real line; saving for the last weeks work in 2-space (the plane) and its point-set topology.Option C (18.100C) is a 15-unit variant of Option B; with further instruction and practice in written and oral communication. This fulfills the MIT CI requirement.     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE

For multidimensional nonparametric statistics; an early approach was to choose a fixed coordinate system and work with order statistics and ranks in each coordinate. A more modern method; to be followed in this course; is to look for rotationally or affine invariant procedures. These can be based on empirical processes as in computer learning theory. Robustness; which developed mainly from around 1964; provides methods that are resistant to errors or outliers in the data; which can be arbitrarily large.

They include the ship Kelvin wave pattern and wave resistance; the interaction of surface waves with floating bodies; the seakeeping of ships high-speed vessels and offshore platforms; the evaluation of the drift forces and other nonlinear wave effects responsible for the slow-drift responses of compliant offshore platforms and their mooring systems designed for hydrocarbon recovery from large water depths. This course was originally offered in Course 13 (Department of Ocean Engineering) as 13.022. In 2005; ocean engineering subjects became part of Course 2 (Department of Mechanical Engineering); and this course was renumbered 2.24.,Graduate,?

How do cells maintain their compositions; volume; and membrane potential?   How are potentials generated across the membranes of cells? What do these potentials do?   Although the questions posed are fundamentally biological questions; the methods for answering these questions are inherently multidisciplinary. As we will see throughout the course; the role of mathematical models is to express concepts precisely enough that precise conclusions can be drawn. In connection with all the topics covered; we will consider both theory and experiment.

In this course; we will explore the mechanisms of action of toxins and antibiotics; their roles in everyday medicine; and the emergence and spread of drug resistance. We will also discuss the identification of new drug targets and how we can manipulate the protein synthesis machinery to provide powerful tools for protein engineering and potential new treatments for patients with devastating diseases; such as cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy. This course is one of many Advanced Undergraduate Seminars offered by the Biology Department at MIT.

Early Stage Capital will consider a broad range of questions that entrepreneurs deal with on this front; including the following: What should your strategy and your priorities be in raising early stage capital? What are the market norms and standards in structuring VC deals? What are the critical negotiating strategies and tactics? How will your company be valued? How can you obtain the optimal valuation for your new venture? What are the critical elements in the relationship between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs? How is the &quot;venture model&quot; evolving? Is it broken? What is the impact of Super Angels and micro VCs? These are key questions that face all entrepreneurs in 2010; particularly first-time entrepreneurs. This course aims to prepare you for these decisions; as either a potential entrepreneur or venture capitalist. Using live interactions with leading figures in the venture finance community; most of the class sessions will analyze fundamental strategies of the venture-capital investment process and the critical importance of the relationship between entrepreneur and investor.

Simple organisms such as baker&rsquo;s yeast; nematodes; fruit flies; zebrafish; mice and rats have allowed biologists to investigate disease at multiple levels; from molecules to behavior. In this course students will learn strategies of disease modeling by critically reading and discussing primary research articles. We will explore current models of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease; childhood genetic diseases such as Fragile X syndrome; as well as models of deafness and wound healing. Our goal will be to understand the strategies biologists use to build appropriate models of human disease and to appreciate both the power and limitations of using simple organisms to analyze human disease. This course is one of many Advanced Undergraduate Seminars offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about current biological research in a highly interactive setting.

These seminars are tailored for students with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about current biological research in a highly interactive setting. To understand and treat any disease with a genetic basis or predisposition; scientists and clinicians need effective ways of manipulating the levels of genes and gene products. Conventional methods for the genetic modification of many experimental organisms are technically demanding and time consuming. Just over 5 years ago; a new mechanism of gene-silencing; termed RNA interference (RNAi); was discovered. In addition to being a fascinating biological process; RNAi provides a revolutionary technology that has already changed the way biomedical research is done and that may even prove useful for genetic interventions in a clinical context. In this course; students learn how RNAi was discovered; how it works; and what its physiological relevance might be.

http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-345-vascular-development-in-life-disease-and-cancer-medicine-fall-2009/index.htm,Vascular Development in Life; Disease and Cancer Medicine | Biology | MIT OpenCourseWare,The growth of blood vessels; a process known as angiogenesis; is one of the earliest events in mammalian development and is regulated by a sensitive interplay of growth factors and other molecules. In this course; we will discuss the key molecular regulators of blood vessel development as well as the techniques and experimental systems that have been utilized by vascular biologists. We will also examine the success of several anti-angiogenic treatments that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); that inhibit the pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGF; and that are now being used to treat age-related macular degeneration. Finally; we will explore how during the course of cancer progression; establishment of a blood supply into a tumor can lead to the growth and spread of cancer cells to secondary sites. We will discuss the caveats and potential pitfalls of targeting tumor blood vessels to starve cancer cells and prevent the spread of cancer; which remains one of the leading causes of death in the USA. This course is one of many Advanced Undergraduate Seminars offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest in teaching.,angiogenesis;growth factors;VEGF;microscopic visualization;intravital imaging;anti-angiogenic treatments;macular degeneration;cancer progression;tumor blood vessels;Cancer;Cellular and Molecular Medicine;Developmental Biology,education;learning;free;,Vascular Development in Life; Disease and Cancer Medicine ,MIT Open CourseWare,N/A,any time,No,Naba; Alexandra and Turner; Christopher ,The growth of blood vessels; a process known as angiogenesis; is one of the earliest events in mammalian development and is regulated by a sensitive interplay of growth factors and other molecules.

A variety of clinical disorders have been shown to include &quot;mitochondrial dysfunction;&quot; which loosely refers to defective oxidative phosphorylation and usually coincides with the occurrence of excess Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production; placing cells under oxidative stress.  A known cause and effect of oxidative stress is damage to and mutation of mitochondrial DNA.

Most differentiated cells therefore retain all of the genetic information necessary to generate an entire organism. It was through pioneering technology of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) that this concept was experimentally proven. Only 10 years ago the sheep Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult organism; demonstrating that the differentiated state of a mammalian cell can be fully reversible to a pluripotent embryonic state. A key conclusion from these experiments was that the difference between pluripotent cells such as embryonic stem (ES) cells and unipotent differentiated cells is solely a consequence of reversible changes. These changes; which have proved to involve reversible alterations to both DNA and to proteins that bind DNA; are known as epigenetic; to distinguish them from genetic alterations to DNA sequence. In this course we will explore such epigenetic changes and study different approaches that can return a differentiated cell to an embryonic state in a process referred to as epigenetic reprogramming; which will ultimately allow generation of patient-specific stem cells and application to regenerative therapy.

Infrastructure Development ,MIT Open CourseWare,N/A,any time,No,de Neufville; Richard and Geltner; David ,This course is an introduction to the analytical tools that support design and decision-making in real estate and infrastructure development. There is a particular focus on identifying and valuing sources of flexibility using &ldquo;real options&rdquo;; Monte-Carlo simulation; and other techniques from the field of engineering systems. This course integrates economic and engineering perspectives; and is suitable for students with various backgrounds. It serves to provide useful preparation for thesis work in the area. The course applies the approach to the design and phasing of a mega infrastructure real estate project. Note This MIT OpenCourseWare site is based; in part; on materials on Design for Real Estate and Infrastructure Development from Professor de Neufville s and Professor Geltner s Web site.

Trends towards further industrialization and globalization portend major challenges for society to manage the adverse impacts of our urban and industrial activities. How serious are current environmental and social problems? Why should we care about them? How are governments; corporations; activists; and ordinary citizens responding to these problems. This course examines environmental and social impacts of industrial society and policy responses. We will explore current trends in industrialization; urbanization; and globalization; analyze the impacts these trends have on human health; environmental sustainability; and equity; and then examine a range of policy options available for responding to current problems. The course will present key trends in both domestic and international contexts. We will examine four policy problems in particular during the course: (1) regulating industrial pollution; (2) regulating  sweatshops  and the broader impacts of globalization; (3) protecting ecosystems; and (4) protecting urban environments during development. We delve into specific cases of these challenges; including: chemical safety and toxins; computers; e-commerce; and the environment; biotech and society; sweatshops; and food production and consumption. Through these cases; we will explore underlying processes and drivers of environmental degradation. Finally; we will analyze opportunities and barriers to policy responses taken by governments; international institutions; corporations; non-governmental organizations; consumers; and impacted communities. Objectives and Aims  An understanding of the complexity of environmental and social impacts of industry; An ability to critically analyze policy responses; An understanding of the roles of different actors and institutions in environmental and social controversies; Means to evaluate institutional barriers to environmental and social policies; New ideas for better integrating industry; environment; and equity; New strategies for regulation in the global economy; An understanding about personal responsibilities and roles in environmental and social problems. ,industrial;scientist;engineer;modern;modern industry;industrialization;globalization;current;environmental;social problems;policy;urbanization;human health;environmental sustainability;equity;Public Policy;Environmental Policy;Globalization;Environmental Management,education;learning;free;,Environment and Society ,MIT Open CourseWare,N/A,any time,No,ORourke; Dara ,Modern industrial activities - which MIT engineers and scientists play a major role in - have significant environmental and social impacts.

What do these have in common? One theory holds that these are all &quot;deviant&quot; social behaviors; occurring both online and off; which have purportedly been brought about or exacerbated by our new media environment. Such aberrant behaviors seemingly give us ample reason to fear digital and social media. But is technology to blame? We will grapple with this question as we investigate how our understanding of new technologies and media is socially shaped and; in turn; how new media might influence our social behavior.  We will begin by studying how similar panics about &quot;old&quot; media (books; film; television and even the written word itself) set historical precedents for these current fears.

What do these have in common? One theory holds that these are all &quot;deviant&quot; social behaviors; occurring both online and off; which have purportedly been brought about or exacerbated by our new media environment. Such aberrant behaviors seemingly give us ample reason to fear digital and social media. But is technology to blame? We will grapple with this question as we investigate how our understanding of new technologies and media is socially shaped and; in turn; how new media might influence our social behavior.  We will begin by studying how similar panics about &quot;old&quot; media (books; film; television and even the written word itself) set historical precedents for these current fears.

Even a supercomputer working at 1 trillion operations per second would take longer than the age of the universe to find a solution when considering each possibility in turn. In 1994; Leonard Adleman published a paper in which he described a solution; using the tools of molecular biology; for a smaller 7-city example of this problem. His paper generated enormous scientific and public interest; and kick-started the field of Biological Computing; the main subject of this discussion based seminar course. Students will analyze the Adleman paper; and the papers that preceded and followed it; with an eye for identifying the engineering and scientific aspects of each paper; emphasizing the interplay of these two approaches in the field of Biological Computing. This course is appropriate for both biology and non-biology majors. Care will be taken to fill in any knowledge gaps for both scientists and engineers.This course is one of many&nbsp;Advanced  Undergraduate Seminars offered by the Biology Department at MIT.  These seminars are tailored for students with an interest in using  primary research literature to discuss and learn about current  biological research in a highly interactive setting.,biological computing;Leonard Adleman;exquisite detection;whole-cell computing;computation;molecular biology;biotin-avidin;magnetic beads;cellular processes;combinatorial problems;self-assembly;nanodevices;molecular machines;quorum sensing;molecular switches;ciliates;molecular gates;molecular circuits;genetic switch;cellular networks;genetic networks;genetic circuits;Biotechnology;Computer Science;Computational Biology;Computation and Systems Biology;Theory of Computation,education;learning;free;,Biological Computing: At the Crossroads of Engineering and Science ,MIT Open CourseWare,N/A,any time,No,Khodor; Julia ,Imagine you are a salesman needing to visit 100 cities connected by a set of roads.
