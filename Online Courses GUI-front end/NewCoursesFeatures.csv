The course is divided into four sections: nuclear systematics; Earth formation and evolution; stable isotopes; and applications to the ocean system.,Marine Isotope Chemistry ,MIT Open CourseWare,Free,any time,No,Peucker-Ehrenbrink; Bernhard and Jenkins; Bill and Fornace; Kyrstin ,The objective of this course is to develop an understanding of principles of marine isotope geochemistry; its systematics; and its application to the study of the behavior and history of the oceans within the earth system.

The problems range from economic growth in the long run; to government finances in the intermediate run; and economic stability in the short run.

http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-581-international-economics-i-spring-2013,International Economics I | Economics | MIT OpenCourseWare,This course covers; with a focus on both theory and empirics; advanced topics in international trade (as well as inter-regional trade and economic geography.) It includes the study of positive issues; such as: Why do countries trade? What goods do countries trade? What are the implications of openness for the location of production; industries; occupations; and innovative activity? And; what impedes trade and why do some countries deliberately erect policy impediments to trade? The course also concerns normative issues; such as: Is trade openness beneficial to a representative agent? And; are there winners and losers from trade and if so; can we identify them? Throughout; these issues are approached in neoclassical settings as well as those with market failures; at the industry-level as well as the firm-level; and in the presence of both mobile and immobile factors (e.g.; FDI; offshoring of tasks; multinational firms and immigration).,International Economics I ,MIT Open CourseWare,Free,any time,No,Costinot; Arnaud and Donaldson; Dave ,This course covers; with a focus on both theory and empirics; advanced topics in international trade (as well as inter-regional trade and economic geography.)
