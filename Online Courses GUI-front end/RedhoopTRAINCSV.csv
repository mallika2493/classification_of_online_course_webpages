In the course; these two domains - controls and robotics - will be interleaved and we will go from the basics of control theory; via robotic examples of increasing complexity - all the way to the research frontier. The course will focus on mobile robots as the target application and problems that will be covered include (1) how to make (teams of) wheeled ground robots avoid collisions while reaching target locations;  (2) how to make aerial; quadrotor robots follow paths in the presence of severe disturbances; and (3) how to locomotive bipedal; humanoid robots. While the main focus of this course is theory; it is important to be able to map the theory onto an actual physical platform. As such; the course will provide detailed instructions on how to build a mobile robot from scratch as an optional part of the course. In addition; an introduction into microcontrollers; mechatronics; and electronics will be given so that; by the end of the course; the controllers developed in the course can run on an actual mobile robot. The course will also feature optional programming assignments; which will focus on implementing the controllers developed in this course for a mobile robot. A MATLAB-based simulator will be available run controllers from the programming assignments on a simulated robot or on the mobile robot built in this course.

However; doing so can cause a problem. The back button is by far the most used navigational element in the browser. It gives people browsing the web; especially newcomers; confidence to click on links as they know they can go back to where they were. They expect it to always work. By updating part of a web page using client-side script; the behaviour of this button is broken. This has the potential to frustrate visitors to the website. The recent introduction of the HTML5 History API allows us to fix this - we can do partial page updates and tell the browser that the content has changed; thereby keeping the back button in full working order. In this course you ll learn how page navigation and the browser history work; how we can break the back button by doing partial page updates; and how to fix it again using the HTML5 History API. We ll also learn how to overcome inconsistencies in the API by using the History.js JavaScript library; and also how this provides support for the history API in older; HTML4 browsers.

The course is introduced with two cases where politics brought tragedies: the hyper-inflation in Zimbabwe and the political idolization in North Korea. These two cases provide a good answer to why we study politics. The central content of the course is organized into two modules. First; it will start with several chapters from Records of the Grand Historian (Chinese: ??); Plutarch s Lives; and History of the Three Kingdoms (???: ????; Chinese: ????) to find out four archetypes of politics: value creation/distribution in a political entity; conflict and cooperation among political entities; development and maintenance of an identity in a political entity; and leadership selection in an entity. The second module of the course will link the four archetypes of politics with contemporary issues of inter-Korean politics and political events in North Korea. These issues will include the Korean Crisis in 2012; the arms race between the two Koreas; the power succession and the simultaneous (nuclear and economic) build-up strategy in North Korea; and upcoming political events.

The way we cast our votes; the way our votes are counted; and the way we choose who will lead are increasingly controlled by invisible computer software. Most U.S. states have adopted electronic voting; and countries around the world are starting to collect votes over the Internet. However; computerized voting raises startling security risks that are only beginning to be understood outside the research lab; from voting machine viruses that can silently change votes to the possibility that hackers in foreign countries could steal an election. This course will provide the technical background and public policy foundation that 21st century citizens need to understand the electronic voting debate.

We ll cover widely used safeguards; checks; and balances — and why they are often inadequate. Finally; we ll see how computer technology has the potential to improve election security; if it s applied intelligently.

These are some of the questions that arise in the context of rationing and allocating scarce health care resources among particular individuals; and concern what are called micro-allocation decisions. But trade-offs also need to be made at the meso- and macro-level. Budgets of public payers of healthcare; such as governments; and of private ones; such as health plans; are limited: they cannot cover all drugs and services that appear beneficial to patients or physicians. So what services should they provide? Is there a core set of benefits that everyone should be entitled to? How can we make fair decisions; if we know from the outset than not all needs can be met? Using the cases of organs for transplantation; the rationing for vaccines in a flu pandemic; and drug shortages; the course will critically examine alternative theories for allocating scarce resources among individuals; while also exploring the principles and values that underlie those theories.','Appropriate for all',yes

While the computing community is racing to build tools and libraries to ease the use of these systems; effective and confident use of these systems will always require knowledge about low-level programming in these systems. This course is designed for students to learn the essence of low-level programming interfaces and how to use these interfaces to achieve application goals. CUDA C; with its good balance between user control and verboseness; will serve as the teaching vehicle for the first half of the course. Students will then extend their learning into closely related programming interfaces such as OpenCL; OpenACC; and C++AMP. The course is unique in that it is application oriented and only introduces the necessary underlying computer science and computer engineering knowledge for understanding. It covers the concept of data parallel execution models; memory models for managing locality; tiling techniques for reducing bandwidth consumption; parallel algorithm patterns; overlapping computation with communication; and a variety of heterogeneous parallel programming interfaces. The concepts learned in this course form a strong foundation for learning other types of parallel programming systems.','Appropriate for all',yes

To explain or to excuse the ongoing hatred towards Jews; historians mix together terminologies and concepts drawn from religious theology; psychology; social theory and politics. The catch-all term  anti-Semitism  lumps together outbreaks of prejudice and victimization in different times and places. In this course; we shall ask a different question. Our focus is not on why a majority society saw Jews as different or reacted with violence to Jews   otherness.  Rather; we ask how in a society dedicated to religious uniformity one group of people was tolerated even though it refused to join the dominant faith. Many modern writers assume that Christianity; and perhaps religion itself; is inherently intolerant of non-believers. But we will see that neither religious nor secular world views necessarily lead to toleration or discrimination. The patterns of Christian-Jewish relations are both complex and intriguing. Our question then is how did a religious society manage to practice tolerance; and under what circumstances did that practice break down? We will focus on the history of Jews in Italy and especially Rome; the city that housed the the longest continuous Jewish settlement in world history and that was also; for most of the past two millennia; the home of the Catholic Church.','Appropriate for all',yes

Secular; but generally repressive and inefficient autocracies have come under pressure or been swept aside entirely. At the same; the various Islamic Republics have not fared much better; but been convulsed by internal unrest; economic and social decline. Throughout the Muslim lands; existing constitutional arrangements are being challenged; often very violently. This course is a survey of the constitutional ideas and institutions that have developed since the mid 19th century throughout predominantly Muslim countries; but its focus will lie on the actors that have dominated this discourse and shaped its outcomes. We will look at the large body of classical writings on the Islamic state only in so far as it is necessary to understand the contemporary debate; but concentrate on the legal and political developments of the 20th and 21st centuries. Three common themes will characterise the course:  We privilege the study of the legal and social reality and seek to highlight where it is at odds with dogmatic stipulations; be they religious or constitutional.  We seek to illustrate the practical tensions posed by limited administrative capabilities and political legitimacy that resulted from the incomplete reception of modern bureaucratic statehood.  We seek to examine how popular dissatisfaction with the practical performance of Muslim governments has fuelled demands for greater accountability under the guise of cultural authenticity.  Ultimately; the course aims to equip participants to better understand Muslim contemporary discourse about the res publica; better contextualise the demands for religious law in public life; and to better ascertain the theoretical and practical feasibility of postulated religious alternatives to the still-dominant secular model of governance.','Appropriate for all',yes

As demobilized troops returned; German cities filled with unemployed; often maimed veterans. The Socialists briefly seized power and by the early 1920s hyperinflation further destabilized the nation. Neue Sachlichkeit or the New Objectivity cast a cold sharp eye on Modern Germany’s hypocrisy; aggression; and destitution even as extremists on the political right consolidated power. The National Socialists or Nazi Party won the chancellorship in 1933 and quickly used art and architecture as a means build the myth of a pure German people shaped by the land and unsullied by modern industrial culture.

It would have been so much easier if we could have included him in Venice; since Pacher was influenced by the work of the great Venetian painter Mantegna. But Pacher spoke German; and the specific area he was from (today in the north-east of Italy); was known as Tyrol (though there is a state of Tyrol today in Austria). Confusing; we know. In this tutorial; we take a look at Pacher’s amazing St. Wolfgang Altarpiece which is still in the church it was made for—a church on a lake surrounded by mountains in Austria; still visited by religious pilgrims. Most altarpieces in the Renaissance were made of many interconnected panels that were later sold and ended up in different collections; and this means that to see one altarpiece you usually have to travel to many museums. But this is not true of the St. Wolfgang altarpiece. Seeing a Renaissance work of art in the space it was made for helps us to travel back in time to the late 15th Century.','Appropriate for all',yes

The subject of prayer is extensive; it s a universal subject; but different in practice; methodology and style based on one’s religious system of beliefs.  Two things that make prayer universal are: definition and faith. The definition is pretty basic among religious beliefs; that is communion with a deity or divine being.  However; the major difference is believing that the Deity or Divine Being has the power and authority to answer you; change circumstances and conditions; as well as transform your life.  Ultimately; this course is designed to provide you with the principles of prayer that will assist you with developing and maintaining an open line of communication with the Almighty One; the Creator of the Universe.  Material for this course includes video; audio; PowerPoint presentations and text/document. Course completion is at the discretion and learning pace of the student. This course will enhance your knowledge about prayer. If you want to develop and maintain a consistent prayer life; learning the core guiding principles that should govern your spiritual life is absolutely essential to your success and effectiveness in your sphere of influence.   (c)2012 Queen E.

Failure to progress is a subjective diagnosis based on Friedman s Curve-- a graph that shows how fast women should dilate during labor. Although most healthcare providers still use Friedman s Curve to dictate how they manage a woman s labor; this curve was published in 1954 and has since become completely obsolete. If more healthcare providers got rid of Friedman s Curve and learned the new; evidence-based definitions of normal and abnormal labor; we would see a drastic decrease in the overall C-section rate. You have the chance to take a class from Rebecca Dekker; the PhD-prepared founder of Evidence Based Birth; and learn the facts about Failure to Progress and Friedman s Curve. By taking this class; you will gain non-biased information about failure to progress; failed inductions; and how to prevent slow progress in labor . In this class you will learn: Why is failure to progress such a big problem? What is the history of Friedman s Curve? What is the normal length of labor in modern women? Can long labors lead to health problems? What are the new; evidence-based definitions of labor arrest and failed induction? How can we help prevent women from having long labors in the first place? Because the class is made up of short videos; you can take the class at your own pace. The class also includes: Printable handouts for you to keep MP3 podcasts you can download Video voice-overs that you can download An interview with a woman who gave birth during Dr. Friedman s time A quiz to check your knowledge Three wrap-up case studies (scenarios) so you can pull everything together A chance for you to ask Rebecca questions Should you take this class?

The biggest mistake committed by newcomers to Options trading is they do not realize that Options trading has a learning curve. Options have a foundation in mathematics; and all the parameters that govern Options pricing (the critical element in Options trading) are dictated by mathematical formulas. Failing to understand the theory and mathematics behind Options is the single biggest factor most people don t succeed in Options trading. They don t understand why they lose money or why the trades they expected to be winners turn out to be losers. The second biggest mistake most people make is that they don t have a clear idea of the roadmap in the Options trading game. They trade strategies they don t fully understand. These two factors combined can deal a deadly blow before they learn the game.  Don t get caught in this situation. Watch this FREE COURSE to know what you re up against. Learn the challenges and the pitfalls  of Options trading so you know what to expect. Once you know this; you can plan methodically; and you will be well on your way to making Options trading a reliable second income for life.

A brief synopsis of the courses are provided blow; but for complete details please visit the individual course links below.   LEARN CALL OPTIONS AND PUT OPTIONS OPTIONS FOUNDATION - TIME DECAY; IMPLIED VOLATILITY; OPTION GREEKS BUYING CALL OPTIONS AND PUT OPTIONS - LIVE TRADES   SECTION I -  Call Options Most people learning Options for the first time face too much jargon and complex language. This course use real-world examples (buying a house) to explain how a Call Option (Section 1) works in real life. This example should make it absolutely clear what a Call Option is in step-by-step details.  SECTION II - Put Options.  The Put Option is the ultimate  protector  of your portfolio; and in this course you can learn how Put Options work. It is the exact opposite of a Call Option. Put Options increase in value when the value of a stock or index drops in price. We define what a Put Option; and just like we did in the Call Option; we consider a real-world example of a Put Option.  SECTION III - Stock and Options combo strategies In this section; three creative strategies are outlined for Stock investors to combine Options into their portfolio strategies. Use Options to buy Stock at prices that are far lower than what the stock is currently trading for Use Options to sell Stock at prices that are far higher than what it is currently trading for Use Options to hedge a Stock position that you already own   SECTION IV - TIME DECAY Time decay is a pivotal component of Options strategies. In fact; time decay alone is responsible for the majority of advanced option strategies. In this part of the course; we are going to study the concept in detail. Options are  wasting  assets; and they lose value every day. The buyer gets hurt from time decay and the seller benefits from it. And time decay becomes more exponential as we approach expiry of an Option. It is also the great equalizer between the profiles of a buyer and seller of Options. Time decay is the great equalizer in the risk / reward profiles of buyers and sellers of Options. Several intermediate and advanced strategies are based on selling premium (option sellers) and these positions make a profit due to time decay in the value of these options over a period of time.   SECTION V - IMPLIED VOLATILITY  Implied Volatility is the  wildcard  in Option prices. Ignore it; and you will pay a price. In fact; it s so important we have at least four different varieties - Volatility; Implied Volatility; Historical Volatility; and Future or Expected Volatility. We use the real-world examples to explain the concept of Volatility in simple terms. Then we study how Volatility is quantified in Stocks and Options. And how Volatility finds a back-door to embed itself into Option prices. Implied Volatility considerations are critical when choosing between a buyer and seller profile. We break this complex topic down into simple terms and show you an example of NFLX and CAT options that should make it absolutely clear what this is all about.   SECTION VI - OPTION GREEKS; DELTA; GAMMA; VEGA; THETA If you re the pilot of an aircraft; the Greeks are your instrument panel. If you don t manage your instrument panel properly; well...you get the picture. Understanding the Greeks are absolutely critical to every Option position. We break this course into easy to understand chapters for all the four Greeks - Delta; the king of all Greeks. Gamma - the silent operator. Theta - every Option seller s dream. And Vega - Watch out for this one.. Most beginners to Options tend to ignore the Greeks. Master the Greeks and you ll shave off months of learning curve. Not to mention; you can then fly your aircraft on  auto-pilot  (with help from the Greeks).   SECTION VII - OPTIONS MARKET STRUCTURE The Options market has a number of terms that we need to be aware of. Starting with terminology differences like  Long  and  Short ; we look at all the details that go into the Options market. We explain the important processes like Exercise and Assignment; as well as things like Expiry series; Bid-Ask spreads; Brokerage and transaction costs and various other details. What is Open Interest and why is it important; and what is the role of a Market Maker. We study the different Order types and which ones are important for the average investor; and which ones make sense in different situations. We also discuss Regulation T Margin as it applies to Options as well as Portfolio margin.   SECTION VIII - BUY A CALL OPTION (CHIPOTLE MEXICAN GRILL) Buying a Call Option is the most basic of all the Option strategies and is the most efficient strategy to optimize a bullish outlook on a stock. In this course; we take the example of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and show how the trade played out. We analyze the rationale behind entering the trade; the risk/reward profile; chart analysis and point of entry; choice of expiry and  moneyness  of the Option; time decay considerations; margin requirements; profit expectations; exit criteria; Greek analysis; its Profit and Loss profile and various other considerations. We provide a 360-degree analysis before trade entry. This is a real trade and over 15 days; and we navigate the trade to its exit point.   SECTION IX - BUYING A PUT OPTION (FXE EURO ETF) Buying a Put Option serves two purposes - exploit a bearish move in the stock or be the ultimate protector of your stock. In this part of the course; we take the example of the Euro ETF (FXE) and show how the trade played out in about 25 days time. We analyze the rationale behind entering the trade; the risk/reward profile; chart analysis and point of entry; choice of expiry and  moneyness  of the Option; time decay considerations; margin requirements; profit expectations; exit criteria; Greek analysis; its Profit and Loss profile and various other considerations. We provide a 360-degree analysis before trade entry. We show you how to  let your winners run  in a controlled manner.   SECTION X - STRATEGY AND OPTIMIZATION  The Option strategy optimization course brings all the 4 Options strategies together. The 4 strategies are comprised of 2 bullish and 2 bearish strategies; but how and when should we choose a particular strategy over the other. We create a helpful  4 strategies box  to distinguish and connect one strategy to the other. Most importantly; what are all the considerations before we choose a strategy. Our choice of strategy depends not only on what the stock is currently doing; but also on various market externalities as well as a few key Option metrics like Implied Volatility. This course also provides a sneak peek into advanced Option topics like the VIX (Fear index ); trade simulation as well as trade adjustment parameters.   SECTION XII - SINGLE OPTION ADJUSTMENTS  This course studies the need for Option adjustments; and why adjustments are as critical to the success of your position as good entry or analysis. We consider all the four basic strategies - the Long Call; Short Call; Long Put; and the Short Put and look at various adjustments to these positions if they get into trouble. Every investor has a  pain point  - this is the point at which they adjust their position. Applying a rigorous approach to this pain point enables investors to control risk while maximizing the opportunity to profit. The course also discusses various details like early adjustments; over-adjusting and adjusting profitable trades as well as the importance of the investor s outlook for the stock when considering adjustments.     This bundle consists of  Courses I through III of a 4-course step-by-step program to achieving Options mastery. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE COURSE IV ON OPTION SPREADS.  Course I - Introduction to Options - Learn about Call Options and Put Options is a detailed step-by-step explanation of Options; Call Options and Put Options with theory and practical application with Apple (AAPL) Options Course II - Options Foundation - Time Decay; Implied Volatility and Options Greeks will complete your theoretical understanding of Options. Course III is Options strategies for Beginners - Buying Call Options and Put Options where we actually put live trades and manage them to their exit points.  Course IV is on Options Spreads - This is the heart of Options Trading.  Once you master Options spreads; you have acquired a skill that can generate consistent monthly income for the rest of your life.      Please feel free to browse this page for a complete list of Testimonials  from our clients; Blog  readers and Linkedin group  members.','Appropriate for all',yes

Most training about communication in the workplace; whether it is oral or written; teaches about the form but not about the content. If you have ever taken a course about public speaking or presentation skills; for example; you probably remember many recommendations about how to deliver your presentation and how to design visual slides. But you probably didn t learn much about how to craft the content of your presentation. The same happens with written communication. Focusing on the form rather than the content is like giving someone a beautiful wine bottle which is empty or contains bad wine. In this course; we will focus on the content. To be fair; there are also good sources on how to prepare the content. But none of them put the information in a simple and logical step-by-step process that can be applied every time to almost any type of communication. This is where this course comes in with five logical steps that will help you craft a powerful message every time you have to communicate.

I mean; it s only a book - just read it; right? Not right. Many have tried to learn it without any help and fallen into the same traps.

Many strange religious beliefs and practices have been birthed from wrong Bible interpretation; but it doesn t have to happen.

In fact; we realized that experiencing beauty can actually be transforming. And; as ironic as it seems since we have all experienced it; that we have to be taught to truly be able to experience beauty in a deep and meaningful way. When we learn how to really experience beauty; our perceptions are awakened; our world becomes more vivid; and our lives become deeper; fuller; and more profound. By learning to deeply experience beauty; we can connect with the world; and the people around us in a whole new; more meaningful way. It engages our spirit; and it transforms our lives.

For self-esteem issues For weight loss sessions For fears; phobias and anxiety For depression or general feelings of gloom and doom Anger And it can be used practically any time…. A client is having a reaction they don’t like. A client has a reaction that’s out of proportion to the current situation. A client shows signs of regression as they’re thinking about their problem (I’ll show you what signs to look for). If you don’t have effective regression techniques; you’re missing out on a valuable set of skills in working with people! When you think about it; regression can be used for a large percentage of the problems clients come to you with. If you’re not using regression; you may be missing a big piece of the puzzle.. And truthfully; a lot of practitioners out there are not confident using the regression techniques they have been taught. Why? A Lot Of Regression Training Out There Is Crap. How Do You Separate The Wheat From The Chaff? I’m a reductionist. I simplify–it’s what I do. And I’ve done lots of reading; studying and testing of various regression formats. But most of them left me dissatisfied. Often; there’s a lot of dogma and superfluous woo-woo attached. And if you look at the evidence behind the theories; there’s little support. So instead of fluff; I focused on what therapeutic processes work best. Then I started to look and what the most successful therapies had in common. I reduced; simplified; threw out the garbage and the unnecessary and came back again. Hone; simplify and hone again. And again. What I finished with is… A Combination Of The Most Effective; Powerful And Practical  Techniques To Locate A Root Cause; Regress Back To It Quickly And Resolve It So Clients Can Live Fulfilled Lives–Without Being Bothered By What Happened In The Past It’s called Hybrid Regression Therapy. It’s stripped down and free of spiritual or religious interpretations and light on psychological mumbo-jumbo. That means you can work with a wider range of people with a wide range of belief systems. It’s adaptable. If you have your own belief system about regression–these techniques can be used–put your own spin on them.','Appropriate for all',yes

Take Python for example - it reads just like the English language less a couple of odd characters (if it doesn’t now; it will soon): We Put Special Emphasis On Django...Why? - Django is based in Python - It’s fast; simple; effective; secure; and ideal for  perfectionists with deadlines  - Built-In User Login (authentication) System - Web-based Admin system (built - in) - Template system that allows basic knowledge of HTML/CSS to design the front-end. - Growing Community for Help/Advice/Best Practices .... and freelance clients (or jobs). - Easy to implement and Launch But I’ve Been Told That I Need To Learn C; C; Objective C and Java? The truth is that you could learn all of these languages and use them to further enhance your coding. But why bother? You’re an entrepreneur; NOT a professional coder. Would you rather learn how to code something quickly and start building your business empire or spend years debugging something that may never launch? It’s time to take your future into your own hands and learn how to start Coding For Entrepreneurs today! How To Be Ultra Successful With This Class - Watch the videos and follow me and do exactly as I do - If you get stuck; rewind and rewatch while copying me again - If you’re still stuck; ask questions! I WILL respond to you really quickly! - Months later if you get stuck; come back and watch the videos all over again :) - Do NOT take notes. Implement what is happening as you see it. - When finished; repeat the classes. Start fresh. Delete Everything. Do it again - Repetition is key: it’s like practicing to master a golf swing or a basketball shot - When you get stuck ASK QUESTIONS - I’ll help you - Remember that learning this will put you light years ahead of other entrepreneurs Build a webpage in 10 minutes ** change resolution to 720p From a student regarding Windows Users:  The easiest way to take this course in terms of learning is through a Linux VM. On Windows; download Virtualbox and a Linux .iso (e.g. Ubuntu). Once downloaded; open Virtualbox; follow the steps to create a Ubuntu VM; select the .iso from your hard drive; install Ubuntu and you re good to go with all the commands mentioned in this course. The only extra command I ve had so far to install pip is  sudo apt-get install python-setuptools .  -- Harry FAQ (Doubters Read This) 1) I am not technical at all; are you sure I should take this class? There was a time you didn t know how to read; or write; or speak; or walk; or... I believe you are not technical because you didn t take the time to learn through the hard times OR because you haven t even tried. Coding For Entrepreneurs has a growing community to help you through the tough times; the Instructor will help; the Django Community is incredible; and often times a simple web search will solve your problem. Getting help is easier than EVER and often comes for free. 2) Is Django actually that good? It s the default choice for Instagram; Mozilla; Pinterest; Disqus; and many; many more. Django is lightweight; super flexible; easy to learn; easy to implement. I believe it s that good. 3) What makes Python a good language for beginners? Python looks closest to the English language next to many other programming languages and therefore is easier to learn. Python uses spaces more often than  ;  or  $  or  {  or  (  like PHP and Ruby use. 4) I already know PHP (or another language); should I learn Python/Django? There are two schools of thought: 1) Yes because it s awesome and makes it easy to implemented web-based projects or 2) No because you don t really need to know more than 1 language. If there is any feeling of desire to learn more; do it. 5) Why don t I just use Wordpress or another platform? I think this is like asking a chef why he doesn t follow someone else s recipe. The other recipe might be fantastic... but it s still following a recipe. A true chef creates. A cook follows. Using a platform can be great...but to truly innovate; you need to know how to do it yourself. var fb_param = {}; fb_param.pixel_id =  6008107163092 ; fb_param.value =  0.00 ; fb_param.currency =  USD ; (function(){ var fpw = document.createElement( script ); fpw.async = true; fpw.src =  //connect.facebook.net/en_US/fp.js ; var ref = document.getElementsByTagName( script )[0]; ref.parentNode.insertBefore(fpw; ref); })();','Appropriate for all',yes

Yet the historical facts and information about water remains little known. Water tells the story of changing human relationships with water over the past 10;000 years and tries to answer some basic questions: How have human attitudes to water changed since people first began to manage their water supplies? What major events in the past have defined our present relationship to water; not as something revered; but treated as an anonymous commodity? Why are we now facing a global water crisis and what are prospects for the future? This is the story of gravity and human ingenuity; of irrigation and aqueducts; of humble farming villages; ancient cities; and the rise and fall of civilizations. We draw on archaeology and hydrology; on anthropology and ancient oral traditions; on classical literature and Islamic agriculture—on a broad array of scientific inquiries in many languages and in all parts of the world.

Before the Civil War; many of America’s best artists went to Europe and stayed. Even after the war; American artists found little enthusiasm for their work unless it was directly informed by European precedents. By the first years of the 20th Century; a small group of American artists began to paint the gritty streets of New York and were called the Ashcan School for their portrayal of life in the tenements. In 1913 however; the Armory Show exhibited advanced American and European art and helped to create a market for the work of Georgia O’Keeffe and other members of modern galleries like Alfred Steiglitz’s 291 and Peggy Guggenheim’s Art of This Century. During the Great Depression artists such as Grant Wood portrayed rural life in the south and midwest and became known as regionalists while other realists such as Edward Hopper rendered the alienation of the modern city. Meanwhile; Surrealist ideas infused a younger generation of artists’ work in Mexico and the US which would result; by the end of WWII; in the first internationally important American art movement; Abstract Expressionism.','Appropriate for all',yes

(2) Teacher preparation needs to be improved or overhauled particularly at the primary level so as to help children learn effectively; and teachers should be given more opportunities for additional in-service training or incentives ti improve their teaching performance.

Any chemist has to understand how to analyze samples - whether they are water samples; blood samples or bits of a painting. Most often chemists do this using instruments of some sort. Machines like mass spectrometers or gas chromatographs can indicate both what s in a sample (qualitative) as well as how much of something there is(quantitative). If you are fascinated by shows like CSI; and have enough basic chemistry; this course would be great for you. However; the course is first and foremost designed for chemistry students working towards their degree. Students who complete this class will understand that analytical instruments are not black boxes; but rather complex tools whose utility depends in detail on how analysts both configure and apply them. Towards that end there are three pimary objectives. First; students will learn facts about major classes of instruments commonly used in chemical analysis. Their knowledge will be captured by the ability to block diagram these complex pieces of equipment; and tailor the specifications to the measurement needs. Second; the course will cover the basics of instrumental calibration and quality control. Analysts will develop the ability to apply calibration curves; internal standards and the method of standard addition as needed for various measurement problems. Finally; students must learn how to select and tailor the best instrumental method given a particular measurement need. This higher level skill involves critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations of the various method; and the ability to understand the context behind a measurement need.','Appropriate for all',yes

This course covers the how and why the Holocaust happened; touching on the key events; perpetrators and dates of the period. As this is an overview course; various in depth topics will be saved for future courses. Some of the course will also be student-led; meaning topics students would like to discuss will be brought up during Live Sessions.  This course is self-paced; making it ideal for those who have work; school or family commitments that may make it difficult to keep up with another course layout.  The class is tailored for non-historians or people without an extensive working knowledge of WWII or the Holocaust. People who fall under that category may want follow my facebook page (http://www.facebook.com/AnnaScanlon) to keep informed of further classes that go into more detail. This course is live; so it is always growing and changing! If you have a course you are interested in taking regarding the Holocaust; please do not hesitate to email me. Future courses may include; but are not limited to: Anne Frank and the Holocaust Children/Teens and the Holocaust (a course specifically for children and teens) Teaching the Holocaust Film/Theatre and the Holocaust Non-Jewish Holocaust victims France and the Holocaust Two Ground Rules of the Course: Please be aware that this course does NOT discuss the politics of the nation of Israel. Its founding is briefly touched on at the end of the course; but a debate about Israel s current politics; or any politics post-1940s is not relevant to the course material. If you wish to discuss this; there are many other courses and platforms for you to do so.  Holocaust denial or revision (i.e. there were no gas chambers) is NOT tolerated in this course. There are plenty of other places to discuss such conspiracy theories. This class operates on the scholarly notion that the Holocaust actually took place.

Moreover they come in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma rays and beyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students; software developers; and practicing scientists.   Digital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia technology revolution we are experiencing today. Some important examples of image and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer during acquisition (e.g.; removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car); and the compression and transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos online; or share photos via a social media website; you use this everyday!); for economical storage and efficient transmission.  This course will cover the fundamentals of image and video processing.  We will provide a mathematical framework to describe and analyze images and videos as two- and three-dimensional signals in the spatial; spatio-temporal; and frequency domains. In this class not only will you learn the theory behind fundamental processing tasks including image/video enhancement; recovery; and compression - but you will also learn how to perform these key processing tasks in practice using state-of-the-art techniques and tools. We will introduce and use a wide variety of such tools – from optimization toolboxes to statistical techniques. Emphasis on the special role sparsity plays in modern image and video processing will also be given.  In all cases; example images and videos pertaining to specific application domains will be utilized.','Appropriate for all',yes

Western Europe was not a peaceful place during the 600 years after the fall of the Roman Empire. Western Europe (what is now Italy; France; Spain; England; etc.) had been repeatedly invaded. The result was a fractured feudal society with little stability and little economic growth. Charlemagne and the Ottonians had partially and briefly unified the West; and of course the Church was a stabilizing institution; but it was only in the 11th Century that everything changed. Now there was finally enough peace and prosperity to allow for travel and for the widespread construction of large buildings. These were; with rare exceptions; the first large structures to be built in the West since the fall of the Romans so many centuries before. We call the period Romanesque (Roman-like) because the masons of this period looked back to the architecture of ancient Rome. The relative calm of the Romanesque period also meant it was possible to travel; and the faithful set out on pilgrimages in great numbers to visit holy relics in churches across Europe. This meant that ideas and styles also traveled; towns grew and churches were built and enlarged.','Appropriate for all',yes

Accounting; algorithms; processes; quarterly figures; market shares; stock options; currency exchange rates etc. In all those areas; strong management tools exist and allow leaders to track their activities; improve their strategy; and overall run their company. But another part the business world; equally important; has no numbers available. Corporate image; stress; creativity; team spirit; assertiveness;  black swans ; aesthetics etc. And a lack of rigor suddenly occurs with the excuse :  Since I can t measure; I can t manage...   This is a mistake. The success of a business depends on its capacity to make a difference regarding competition. And today s differences in the eyes of a customer are probably built more on perception than on reality. To help leaders to be rigorous even without figures; great philosophers have lots of ideas. Managers are invited to rediscover the art of thinking. They should understand the role of mental models; realize the importance of cognitive bias; agree on clear definitions and efficient criteria etc. When one says; for example;  We should think creatively about the future of the company;  our minds immediately focus on the word  company;  which is part of the daily life. But it is important to split the sentence into 4 pieces and to pay some attention to three other key words namely  think ;  creatively  and  future . They all must be considered as separated topics. Creativity demands the ability to unshackle ourselves from conventional ways of thinking; to  think outside the box . But we need to go a step further. Once outside the box; we need to construct a new box or boxes (that is; new intellectual frameworks or models) to help us structure our thinking. Only once we have done so can we generate truly game-changing ideas.','Appropriate for all',yes
