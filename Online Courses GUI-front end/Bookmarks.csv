https://redhoop.com/coursera-buddhism-and-modern-psychology-10151-2.html,'Online Course - Buddhism and Modern Psychology', , , ,'Online Course - Buddhism and Modern Psychology',Coursera,Free,'6 weeks',Yes,N/A,'The Dalai Lama has said that Buddhism and science are deeply compatible and has encouraged Western scholars to critically examine both the meditative practice and Buddhist ideas about the human mind. A number of scientists and philosophers have taken up this challenge. There have been brain scans of meditators and philosophical examinations of Buddhist doctrines. There have even been discussions of Darwin and the Buddha: Do early Buddhist descriptions of the mind; and of the human condition; make particular sense in light of evolutionary psychology?  This course will examine how Buddhism is faring under this scrutiny. Are neuroscientists starting to understand how meditation works? Would such an understanding validate meditation—or might physical explanations of meditation undermine the spiritual significance attributed to it? And how are some of the basic Buddhist claims about the human mind holding up? Well pay special attention to some highly counterintuitive doctrines: that the self doesnt exist; and that much of perceived reality is in some sense illusory. Do these claims; radical as they sound; make a certain kind of sense in light of modern psychology? And what are the implications of all this for how we should live our lives? Can meditation make us not just happier; but better people?','Appropriate for all',

This course will help you learn about life in the ocean; how ocean ecosystems function; how scientists study the ocean; and the challenges we face in sustaining healthy oceans for the future. These topics will be explored using case studies that focus on charismatic marine megafauna species – the most compelling creatures in the ocean that capture our attention and inspire us to learn more. The course starts with an examination of the physical dimensions of the worlds ocean and how we describe ocean zones based on the ecosystems found within them. Once these basics are covered; we will work through the evolution of life in the oceans and explore how marine animals have adapted to the challenges of a cold; dark and deep ocean. Throughout the class we will highlight how scientists study the oceans and the animals that live in them; providing glimpses of new technologies that boost our understanding of marine ecology. The course will also cover some of the challenges the oceans face due to human activities - exploring issues such as bycatch and climate change - and how they are affecting ocean species and systems. Throughout the course we will connect with real marine science through the use of open access scientific articles published in the journal PLOS ONE. This means you will have to learn how to read scientific papers and extract the important bits of information from them. The articles youll be reading are all part of a new PLOS Collection focused on using open access research to teach marine science and conservation. You will also get to look at real datasets produced by scientists studying marine creatures and visualize them in freely available programs such as Google Earth.','Appropriate for all',

How does your position in a social network (dis)advantage you? What do game theory and the Paris subway have to do with Internet routing? How might a social network influence election outcomes? What are the economics of email spam? How does Google find what you re looking for... and exactly how do they make money doing so? Networked Life looks at how our world is connected -- socially; strategically and technologically -- and why it matters. The answers to the questions above are related. They have been the subject of a fascinating intersection of disciplines; including computer science; physics; psychology; sociology; mathematics; economics and finance. Researchers from these areas all strive to quantify and explain the growing complexity and connectivity of the world around us; and they have begun to develop a rich new science along the way. Networked Life will explore recent scientific efforts to explain social; economic and technological structures -- and the way these structures interact -- on many different scales; from the behavior of individuals or small groups to that of complex networks such as the Internet and the global economy. This course covers computer science topics and other material that is mathematical; but all material will be presented in a way that is accessible to an educated audience with or without a strong technical background. The majority of the course is grounded in scientific and mathematical findings of the past two decades or less (often much less). Networked Life is the flagship course of the new Networked and Social Systems Engineering program at the University of Pennsylvania.','Appropriate for all',

This figure represents about 3.5 percent of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030. The European Commission estimated that; by 2020; Europe will need between euro 1.5tn and euro 2tn of infrastructure investments. In the time period between 2011 and 2020; about euro 500bn will be required for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) programme; euro 400bn for Energy distribution networks and smart grids; euro 200 bn on Energy transmission networks and storage and euro 500bn for the upgrade and construction of new power plants. An additional euro 38-58bn and euro 181-268bn capital investment will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion. Traditionally; investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However; severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. The course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoints of equity; debt and hybrid instruments. The course is concentrated on the practical aspects of project finance; the most frequently used financial technique for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies allows students to link the theoretical background to actual business practice. At the end of the course; students will be in the position to analyze a complex transaction; to identify key elements of the deal and to suggest proper solutions for deal structuring from the perspective of a financial advisor.','Appropriate for all',

This course familiarizes you with some main theories of international relations; shows how the global order is gradually changing and discusses how selected international and regional organizations contribute to the maintenance of global peace and security. You learn what research findings tell us in terms of the capacity of international organizations and actors to help prevent or stop violent conflict; what tools are used to negotiate agreements and how foundations for sustainable peace are best created. In the course; we also focus on the role of the European Union (EU) in terms of diplomacy and efforts to prevent conflict; the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the contribution of organizations such as the African Union (AU) to the prevention of conflict and war. We also look at activities of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and; in the context of a final debate; see in which ways its membership could be adapted to more accurately reflect the power relations of the current global order. You learn about all of these topics by doing quizzes and exercises testing your knowledge of these subjects; helping you understand crucial concepts and get insights into how the academic study of international relations and international organization can contribute to the search for global stability and peace in practice.','Appropriate for all',
